And thus Cactus Mistletoe created her perfect private philosophy of her life, and perhaps she has forgotten if she has ever had a "real identity".

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Woah! Welcome to the jungle!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}User Dave, this is no ordinary jungle. A scan of my records indicates that this is the fabled Lost City.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Historical texts state that the Sun was worshipped here. Resources should be plentiful.\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I suggest that we try planting on the Gold Tiles that we find here.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}They should continuously generate sun as long as they have plants on them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Lost City? This is it Penny! We've found it!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:crazydave}Where else would I find my lost taco, except in a Lost City?\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:winnie}Your continued fixation defies all logic or reason, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Come here seeking adventure, have you?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Unfortunately for you, the Porter Gargantuars are about to ruin your day!\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}They carry imps. Imps! Prepare to become ancient history!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_4]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I wish someone would carry me around in a tiny house!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}I wish for a lot of things, User Dave. That is not one of them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie} Alert, User Dave! My sensors sense incoming Imp Porters.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Importers? Of fine goods and glassware?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Negative. They pitch tents on Gold Tiles, and the tents spawn zombies.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Imps with bad inTENTs!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate movement incoming from above.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Maybe it's presents. Presents from the sky!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}The chances of that statement being true are statistically irrelevant.\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I believe it to be a new form of zombie threat. We should be cautious of unexpected guests.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Beware, User Dave! I detect trap tiles.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are triggered by zombies, or when you plant on them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}And then they give you tacos?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}If you equate tacos with jets of flame and huge boulders, then yes.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}We are facing considerable threats, User Dave. I suggest that we retaliate with tremendous force.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}More forceful! That's it! We'll give them all a stern talking to.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I was referring to the Lava Guava. Its explosive blasts leave behind dangerous magma.\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That sounds even better! First a stern talking, then some lava!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave. I detect a zombie with a shovel.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Can he dig it?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}It appears to block incoming shots. We need a way to get projectiles over the shovel.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}I know! TELEKINESIS!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Try again, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon} Do not think to usurp our discovery of the fabled Lost City!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}I and my zombies have already submitted our find to the Eminent Journal of the Missing and the Mislaid!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}We will publish and you will PERISH!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Look, Penny! A shiny doo-jickey-ma-thing!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate this amulet points the way to a long-lost challenge.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Let’s do some deft discovering!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}All that discovering and still no taco!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:winnie}The search will no doubt continue, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}My discovery remains intact. The taco is still unfound. And your brains will certainly one day be mine!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Well lookie-here, Penny! It's a treasure map!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{SAY:winnie}My analysis suggests that the origins of that map are highly suspect.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:crazydave}It has a big red X on it, Penny. When have big red Xs ever been bad?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY:winnieicon}User Dave, we have encountered a scroll.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}I love side-scrollers! They're my second favorite kind of game.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:crazydave}But there are so many unfamiliar symbols here.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_4]
{SAY:winnie}Knowledge gives people the ability to judge right from wrong...

{EXCITED:winnie}They appear to need our protection!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Let's get to it! After all, bananas are a very a-PEELING fruit!

{TIRED:winnie}User Dave, if I had a head, I would be shaking it right now.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My research indicates that the sport of bowling experienced a heyday during this era.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_2]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_3]
{TIRED:winnie}I find your thought process indecipherable, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_4]
{SAY:winnie}I was thinking that Bowling Bulbs would make excellent allies here.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_5]
{SAY:crazydave}Huh. I was thinking how much I love wearing bowling shoes.

{PLAYFUL:crazydave}I catch your drift, Penny. You're talking about Chomper!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_4]
{SAY:winnie}Indeed. His sharp teeth could turn the tide of battle.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Hey, I have an idea too! We could call this Chomper Week!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:winnie}... and far too much water. It will overwhelm the plants.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_6]
{SAY:crazydave}No problem-o! We'll just lay down some Lily Pads.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_7]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Then the other plants can ride the waves!

{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}That dude is totally gnarly.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:winnie}He is also quite unpleasant, User Dave. Quite unpleasant.

{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}Dudes, like, you're totally in for it now!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_2]

{PLAYFUL:crazydave}I am?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_5]
{TIRED:winnie}No. No you are not. However, you have given me an idea.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_6]
{EXCITED:winnie}Guacodile! This plant fights zombies with pit-like projectiles.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_7]
{SAY:winnie}And he employs a powerful bite as well.

{EXCITED:winnie}Plant him on the front lines. You'll see.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED:crazydave}Whew! Fighting zombies that arrive in waves AND tides isn't easy.

{EXCITED:crazydave}You know what we need, Penny? An ally with a lot of 'tude!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_3]
{SAY:crazydave}And by 'tude, I mean attitude. In case you need translation.

{SAY:winnie}Then I suggest we call upon Homing Thistle.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_5]
{SAY:winnie}I believe he has this 'tude you speak of.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_6]
{EXCITED:crazydave}His eyes! Intense! He can shoot the zombies a real mean look.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_7]
{EXCITED:winnie}More importantly, he can shoot deadly darts that home in on their target.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_8]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Two painful blows for the price of one! Radical!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}The tide comes in, the tide goes out. Who can explain it?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_5]
{TIRED:winnie}That would be science, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Yo beach bums! Don't flip your lid.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}But have you noticed that Chomper and Bikini Zombie have been ultra cozy lately?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Could a beachside plant-zombie romance be in bloom?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Speaking of which, how sure are you of Chomper's loyalties?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}I can't help but notice ... that plant has the appetite of a zombie.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:zombossicon}Chew on that land lovers! Later dudes!\r\nDr. Zomboss

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}A plant-zombie romance? Penny ... my mind is BLOWN!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_8]
{SAY:winnie}User Dave, do not jump to conclusions. I suggest something more productive.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_9]
{EXCITED:winnie}Let us jump into the action!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:winnie}Alert! I've detected a strange statue of surfing-era significance.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Well lookie there! It's a tiki statue. With crazy eyes.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:winnie}Analysis indicates this tiki could inflict a terrifying challenge upon any who follow it.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}So you're saying that a tiki torture awaits? Get it? A tiki TORCH-er?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{TIRED:winnie}User Dave, I must say, your pun is...\r\nTORCH-er-ous.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}A plant-zombie romance? That's just craaaazy!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SHOUT:crazydave}And I know a thing or two about craaaazy!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:winnie}I concur. I suspect Dr. Zomboss was attempting to sow seeds of discontent.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:crazydave}From now on, we are the only ones sowing seeds around here!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Totally bogus! Little do you know what I have in store for you!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:zombossicon}But for now, I gotta split. Catch you dweebs later!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_1]

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:crazydaveicon}You already won, Penny? Wow. You're good at this!

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I am picking up a grid of plants, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}My scans suggest that they can be swapped to create matches of three.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I saw a game like that once on my telephoney!

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}You can use sun to upgrade the plants.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Make 100 matches to defeat the zombies!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}Greetings Plant Rustler,

{SAY:zombossicon}Agents are arriving to mark your brains as my property.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}I don't want my brains all marked up.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}It took forever to get 'em clean.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Have you considered that you are sharing in Crazy David's madness?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}There is no zombie outbreak threatening you.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}You are not using plants to defend your home.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}The zombies and I are normal people, simply trying to help you.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}I bet you'll tell us there are no spoons, too!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_1]

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SPECIAL14}There's a sunset. Let's ride!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_3]
{EXCITED:winnie}Where do you think the future will take us?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}The Future you say?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:crazydave}We should take another look at my Time-Space Taco Map.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}My Uncle Milo used to have one these, he called it a boom box.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}Actually, that's close enough. I'll allow it.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Maybe we can use that to unlock our minds.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}I still have some cleaning to do.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:winnie}It would be better used gaining access to a World.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{TIRED:winnie}You know, for the greater good of...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}The Taco! I almost forgot.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{EXCITED:crazydave}That's right! These plants versus you and your zombies.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:crazydave}And we didn't even use any spoons...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Even though those things totally exist!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}I admit you are correct in this regard.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}We have no existential conflict over the nature of spoons.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{START_DIALOG_MUSIC}That looks like it could be all futurey.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_10]
{SAY:zombossicon}Sincerely, Dr. Edgar Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_11]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_12]
{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}That Mr. Boss guy seems like a really nice fellow!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_13]
{TIRED:winnieicon}We should be wary of that one User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_14]
{SAY:winnieicon}In the meantime...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_15]
{EXCITED:winnieicon}Earning Stars will prepare you for Star Gates we find later!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_16]
{SAY:winnieicon}Also, Endless Zones will keep you sharp for future trials.

{SAY:crazydaveicon}{SPECIAL15}Just remember. Tomorrow is always a taco...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_18]
{SPECIAL16:crazydave}And a taco is what we find inside of all of us.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_2]
{PLAYFUL:crazydaveicon}I bet Future Dave has solved our taco paradox.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}I'm detecting a rush of tachyon particles.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:winnieicon}Maybe Future Penny is trying to make contact.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_5]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Greetings temporal commuters.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_6]

{TIRED:crazydave}Can you translate that into Crazy Dave Talk for me?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_3]
{TIRED:winnie}There are evil potions on the lawn!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Evil medieval potions! They're the most dangerous kind...

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}On account of having twice the evil!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:winnie}Also, sun no longer falls from the sky.

{SAY:winnie}User Dave, the vapours are no longer considered a real ailment.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_3]
{SAY:winnie}But I believe Fume-shroom will be of use here.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_4]
{EXCITED:winnie}His vapors are quite real and provide a distinct advantage against the right zombie opponents.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Fume-tastic! Let's give the zombies a case of the vapours instead!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:winnie}Data suggests the Dark Ages were a time of intellectual decline and moral  confusion.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_2]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}Perhaps now is a good time to call upon the persuasive powers of the Hypno-shroom?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_HYPNOSHROOM_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Good idea, Penny! We'll convert the wicked – Dark Ages style!

{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Until they see that it was their fellow zombies! Then, mind BLOWN!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}According to my data, iron and other metals were routinely put to use during the Dark Ages.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}Thus, Magnet-shroom should make an excellent ally here.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}He can pull buckets, helmets and other metal objects off of zombies!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_4]

{EXCITED:winnie}User Dave! Perhaps you are not as cerebrally unsound as you periodically insist!

{PLAYFUL:winnie}What if there was one plant that behaved like both a Pea-shooter AND a Wall-nut?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_5]
{SAY:winnie}We would call it a ... Pea-nut!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_6]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Two plant powers in one legume's body?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_7]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Keep talkin' like that and people are going to call you Crazy Penny!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_8]
{SAY:crazydave}Which would be weird for both of us.

{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}A question for you, my Ignoble Foes!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Hast thou noted how violent thine plants become upon consuming Plant Food?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Verily, I shall tell thee. It's zombies! Plant food is made out of zombies!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Unpossible! We feed our plants only the highest quality organic uhm...

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{TIRED:crazydave}Hey Penny, what is Plant Food made of?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:winnie}I fear the true nature of Plant Food requires further analysis, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_8]
{TIRED:winnie}Excuse me while I run some tests.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Why would anyone go and stick a nice sword into a dirty ol' rock?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{TIRED:winnie}I understand it to be a test, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:winnie}Only someone with great physical strength and strength of character may remove it.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{SAY:crazydave}I bet someone with a jackhammer could remove it.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}A CRAAAZY someone!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_6]
{TIRED:winnie}An inelegant but no doubt effective solution to the test, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I have found no evidence that Plant Food contains zombies or zombie byproducts.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{TIRED:crazydave}Phew! Plants shouldn't eat zombies who eat plants.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Except Chomper. He has to. Dude needs the fiber.

{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Why dost thine time-traveling jalopy lie to thee?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}Perchance, a question best left for another day?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:zombossicon}Now, I pray, imagine maniacal laughter as I depart.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Alert, User Dave. My sensors indicate we have moved 153,954,765 years into the past.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Yabbers! That's before I was even born!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Correct. We seem to have landed in some form of Jurassic Marsh.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I knew I smelled more oxygen!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Look, Penny! A fresh star-hunky!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_2]

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave} Bigger? Like, super burrito-sized?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_15_OUTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}More like super Seattle-sized. I hope history has not gone awry...

{EXCITED:crazydave}I know! Gymnosperms, right?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I was thinking more in terms of saurians, User Dave. Dinosaurs.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}They won't attack us directly and we can't affect them.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}However, they will definitely react to zombies. Be wary!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Beware the Jurassic Bully zombies, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are immune to the Primal Peashooter's knockback effect.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Zuh? But how? Even Gargantuars get knocked back!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}True, User Dave. The Bully is simply too stupid to observe typical physics.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_23_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I detect Primal Potato Mines nearby, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_23_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Their prepaleolithic potency will far exceed our more refined modern versions.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Indeed, User Dave. A herd of stegosaurs approaches.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate they will snare zombies with their tail, and then flick them off.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That's what I would do!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_8_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I have analyzed a new plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Stay right where you are. I have an enormous rock scheduled to make your acquaintance.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}I just hate a ticking rock!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I see a toenail! Of unusual size!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}This raptor claw bespeaks an ancient arena of dinosaurian dimensions, User Dave!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I detect an incoming meteor, User Dave

[NARRATIVE_DINO_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]

{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}Special couriers have been dispatched to retrieve your brains.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Please have your release forms signed before their arrival.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Regards, Dr. Edgar Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Cool, that Mr. Boss guy wants your autograph!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:winnie}This can't be good.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}My taco tastes so close I can smell it!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:winnie}Beware, User Dave. Dr. Zomboss still stands in our way.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:crazydave}What does that guy have against tacos and me eating them?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Bah! My reasoning is simple yet beyond your comprehension!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}Now face my Zombot Sphinx-inator in battle!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:winnie}Though tetrahedrons are pyramids, this one is not a Platonic solid.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I'm so hungry, I would love a Platonic solid.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{TIRED:winnie}User Dave, this is also not a taco salad.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Look, Penny! A Pirate Key! It's pirate-y!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}This will enable us to travel to another time.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Sounds salty! Taco... ahoyyyy!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL}Wait a minute!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{TIRED:crazydave}There was never any meat in that taco.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I still have Tofunky in my beard to prove it!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Well, that just leaves more brains for us... later.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}I'll find you again, in another where and another when!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}{SPECIAL3}Let's go get my taco!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_6]
{TIRED:winnieicon}...

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED}Good news! Penny found a map to my taco!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{TIRED}No, that is a time-space map to the plants that can help us.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_3]
{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}{SPECIAL3}Let's go get my taco!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_4]
{TIRED:winnieicon}...

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Flashback! I remember this décor from when I chased squirbos as a kid!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Indeed, User Dave. We appear to have arrived in the midst of a Neon Mixtape Tour.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I suspect the musical tempo may affect the zombies' speeds.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I'm feeding the rhythm, I'M FEEDING THE RHYTHM!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Somebody passed me a note in homeroom, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}It says to meet behind the bike racks at lunchtime for a funderful surprise!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I believe some skepticism about this note is in order, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Do you feel that you have grooved? Did you bang your head? Have you \

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Now the party is over! Melt before the musical might of my majestic Hair Metal Gargantuar!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I'm scared, Penny! It's two minutes to midnight!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Be brave, User Dave. We'll jilt this ditty... on rock and roll!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Mmm! Penny, do you smell something scrum-dicious?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:Winnie}No, User Dave. Only Breakdancer Zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Maybe they’re garlic-flavored!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}I believe special zombies may display unique abilities while their preferred music is playing.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}You mean they'll jam their jam when their jam is jamming?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Yes, correct, yes, and yes, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Spore-shrooms have a unique ability, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}If they defeat a zombie, a new Spore-shroom will spawn where that zombie fell.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazyDave}Hey-wah-zoo! Spore-shrooms mean more shrooms!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Say, do you think Intensive Carrots can be used to revive defeated plants?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}That’s... that’s exactly correct, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Sorry. It just confuses me when you pay attention.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I got a real Cactus feeling about this, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Indeed, Cactus has changed over time, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Now she fires a thorn for ranged damage, but hides for ground damage when zombies approach.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That's so Cactus... always varying her attack and defensive profiles!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Hmmmm... you’re in danger above. You’re a fool; and so knew I!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Hear me now: Ever shall you give up; ever shall you be down; always you’ll run aground, I’ll revert you.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}I intend to make you cry; I mean for you to say goodbye; I'm not really that nice a guy – I alert you!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Ouch!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}Yarbs! That was close... with so many exciting timing and rhythm changes!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}I fear we have only hit pause on Dr. Zomboss’s heinous deal.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_3]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Indeed, next verse, same and yet worse! I go now to when you cannot imagine!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Penny! Penny! Penny! A microphone!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Karaoke time! At last my tangerine dreams will come true!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave. This dropped mic promises a banned battle of heavy petal proportions! 

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Penny! A grid of plants for swappin'!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Indeed, User Dave. Plants can be swapped to create matches of 3 or more.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}You must make 125 matches to defeat the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}You can use sun to upgrade your plants.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:winnie}I detect three different Power-Ups, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are Power Shuffle, Power Shovel, and Power Zap.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Power Shuffle scrambles the board if you are having trouble finding a match.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Power Shovel fills in a crater, allowing an eaten plant to be replaced.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Power Zap power zaps zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_6]
{SAY:crazydave}I was confused about that last one!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}SO MUCH SWAPPING, PENNY!!!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie} Indeed, it is a gauntlet, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}However, my sensors detect a rich reward if we persevere.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}Keep calm and swap on!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Whew! That plant grid was rough like old sausage!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Correct, User Dave. However, we should expect a rich coin reward for our efforts.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Alert, User Dave! My batteries are losing power.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}But you need power to roll your windows up and down!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Correct. Perhaps some electrical plants can restore my charge.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}That's so plausible, it just might work!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:winnie}My batteries are nearly charged, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Wahoo! So many electrons!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}That Electric Currant is sparky AND sparkly!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie} Indeed, its electrical power is most invigorating.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}It will make an excellent addition to our collection.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I have detected an Electric Currant plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Two in the same row or column will create an electric field between them.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}The field will damage zombies and recharge my batteries.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}What a positive development!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I detect mine carts, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Use them to zap zombies with Electric Currant fields.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Watt a great idea!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}All this electricity makes my face-beard hurt! Can we stop for a beach break?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Of course, User Dave. Prepare for Beach Party onslaught.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Can we have bananas?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Bananas will be provided.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave} How are your batteries, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are charging nicely, User Dave, thank you for inquiring.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}The Electric Currants are most helpful.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}They sure make a powerful coulomb-ination!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Note the rolling boulders.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}When triggered they destroy plants and zombies alike.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Attention, User Dave! I have audio-detected a large stash of zombie gems. 

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Heard the horde's hoard, huh?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}If we move swiftly, we may be able to claim them for our own.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}Hi-ho-Gem-Jam, awaaaaay!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Those gems are so close I can smell 'em!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Like gooseberries in springtime!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Hsss! Rascals! Gem-poaching scoundrels!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}No matter! My plans proceed apace!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The zombies are aware of our gem quest, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They intend to attack us from the sea.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}We'll sea about that! Bowling Bulbs, LET'S ROLL!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}I smell leather! And electricity!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}My sensors register a plant lost in time.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}I smell a rescue! And oranges!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Our missing plant is the Gold Bloom, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}It produces an immediate bounty of sun when planted!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Instant sun? Not good enough! MUST GO FASTER!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Gold Bloom is unstuck in time, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Luckily I can track it whenever it goes.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Hang on, little sprout! We're a-comin'!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}We did it! I am a hero to all plants!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}I am concerned about the strange portals we encountered, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie} I believe some unfortunate chicanery may be afoot.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}HA! HA-HA-HA! HA!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}I am amused!

[NARRATIVE_ESCAPEROOT_LOD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Tap the Escape Root, then tap another plant, to make them switch places.

[NARRATIVE_ESCAPEROOT_LOD_2]
{SAY:winnie}Escape Root explodes when a zombie gets close.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_LASTSTAND_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}I like to save some sun for a rainy day.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_LASTSTAND_A_2]
{TIRED:winnie}It can get you out of a pickle or into an E.M.Peach.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY}You can pick your friends, but you can't pick these plants.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_A_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{EXCITED:crazydave}But some of my best friends are plants!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{TIRED}Looks like we don't have much firepower here Penny.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY}With a good supply of sun...

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_3]
{EXCITED:winnie}Magnifying Grass can pack quite the punch.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PROTECTPLANTS_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Protect those Citrons!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PROTECTPLANTS_A_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}It takes a lot of pulp to stand your ground like that.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_3]
{TIRED:winnie}...

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_4]
{SAY:crazydave}Hey, what happened to the lawn? It’s so glowy!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:winnie}I’m detecting an array of Power Tiles on the space-lawn.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}Welcome back Gardener,

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}In this year your brains were collected ages ago.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Collect them again soon, Dr. Edgar Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Watch out neighbor, I'm pretty sure he wasn't talking about my BRAINS!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}I would say there's evidence to the contrary.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Isn't it convenient that your neighbor is so helpful in your fight against us zombies?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Crazy David's apparent incompetence is only eclipsed by his usefulness.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}However, with one secret word my sleeper agent will turn against you.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Listen to me David, \

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SPECIAL1}Hey neighbor!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{PLAYFUL}Can I borrow your brains? Um, I mean hot sauce!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MAGNIFYING_GRASS_FAILURE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY}Oops, you should give it another shot!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}You can decide to launch one mower early now.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}Just press and hold a mower when the time is right.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Sometimes that's the most strate-logical thing to do!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I spy with my crazy eye a U.F.B.! An unidentified flying brain!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}Something more formidable than a brain lies within.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SPECIAL2}Oh! That was...hypno-MAZING!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I want to eat THAT hypno-taco again! I need my TIME MACHINE!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{TIRED:crazydave}What? Wait a minute... what was I saying again?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Hypno-Zombnosis... Hypno-ZOMBNOSIS!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}Drats, or was it Zombno-Hypsosis?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}It says there’s an error.  Can you come here and fix it Penny?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{TIRED}Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in?

[NARRATIVE_HEROES_EVENT_001_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:greenshadow}{SAY:greenshadow}Face forward, true believers!

[NARRATIVE_HEROES_EVENT_001_INTRO_2]
{SAY:greenshadow}The battle between plants and zombies has become SUPER-POWERED!

{SAY:greenshadow}Thanks to the Hero-Tron 5000!

[NARRATIVE_HEROES_EVENT_001_INTRO_4]

{SAY:winnie}I propose we deploy Chard Guard. He has a secret up his leaves.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}You mean his ol' Knock 'Em Dead maneuver?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_6]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}It’ll knock those zombies back where they came from!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_7]
{TIRED:winnie}I guess it's not a secret any more, now is it User Dave?

{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Neat-o! You know, they say revenge is a dish best served cold.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}But I say it's best served hot. Fiery hot! With extra hot sauce.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_FLAMETHROWER_6]

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My data suggests Hurrikale would be of great use here.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}A blast of air from him, and the zombies will chill out and slow down!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}The guy's a real blow hard. And I mean that in the nicest way possible.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_ICEBLOCKS_4]
{SAY:crazydave}I'm warming up to the idea already!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}It's too quiet. Where is everyone? I have a bad feeling about this.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_2]
{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate there are zombies hiding under the ice.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_3]
{SAY:crazydave}I know this game! They call it Hide & Eat Brains.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Time for a game of our own: I call it Whack-A-Zombie.

{SAY:winnie}Whack them good and they will surely drop better hammers.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_6]
{SAY:crazydave}I'm sorry. Can't help it. Have to say it. It's ... hammer time.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_1]

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_3]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}Time to turn up the heat. I recommend Pepper-pult for the job.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_PEPPERPULT_4]
{SAY:winnie}He lobs hot peppers at zombies and also keeps nearby plants warm.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}User Dave, perhaps it's time to try a new tactic.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_3]
{SAY:winnie}Data suggests Stunion would make for a ... potent ... ally here.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Great idea, Penny! That guy's breath is stunning!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_5]
{SAY:crazydave}Not even exaggerating. He stuns zombies ... with his bad breath.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_6]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Gross. But also, pretty nifty!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Penny, what we need right now is a nice hot cup o' cocoa!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_2]
{SAY:winnie}User Dave, that is an unproven zombie-fighting weapon.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_3]
{SAY:winnie}I recommend we call on Rotobaga instead.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_4]
{EXCITED:winnie}She can hover above ground AND shoot at zombies in four directions!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Kid's got talent! Maybe she knows how to make hot cocoa too?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED: winnie}User Dave, I've detected an incoming ice cube.

{EXCITED:crazydave}Looks like a zombie-sicle to me.

{SAY:crazydaveicon}Uh ... me neither. Thath would be craaaazthy.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_4]
{SAY:winnieicon}Sigh. While your tongue heals, please note the strange stone tablet. 

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_5]
{SAY:winnieicon}It appears to be a warning sign, written in Cave Zombie.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_6]
{PLAYFUL:crazydaveicon}Doesth it warn people not to lick ice-thickles?

{SAY:crazydave}Let me get your mowers back to fightin' form.

{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED}That's it. Please disrupt this anomaly before User Dave gets too attached.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED}User Dave, this does not look like a party.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL}It could still be a surprise party, with gifts and everything!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}You'll see Penny, I think these zombies are different.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{EXCITED}There is an impending attack on your house in modern times!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED}I bet it's not an attack... I bet it's a party! Oh, I hope it's a Piñata Party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnieicon}It's not a party, there are zombies from all different time periods ready to strike!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:winnieicon}Who knows what else they could have brought with them?

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydaveicon}Sounds like a party to me! Better hurry up, we don't want to miss out!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}The party is over for now, but those zombies will be back some day.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_2]

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED}Just let us know of any more Piñata Parties you detect!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydaveicon}For a party they can be pretty sneaky.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}What did I tell you Penny? A surprise Piñata Party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED}Does not compute. It appears a level 3 diagnostic check is in order.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Piñatas! Let's bust some open and see what we get!

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}Now here's a break with tradition.

{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}Facebreaker is a blast from the past, right to your face!

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{TIRED}It's called Vasebreaker, User Dave. Vasebreaker.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_1_INTRO_7]
{EXCITED:crazydave}...OOOOOOOO! Sorry, I was busy screaming \

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}We have picked up a Shadow-shroom seed packet, User Dave. 

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie} Shadow-shrooms are shadow plants, so be sure to plant them next to Moonflowers for bonus effects.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave} Adjacency wins again!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}No, User Dave! You must not! I detect high levels of trappiness!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_15_OUTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}But... HUNGY... CHOW... TACO!

{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Fools! You have fallen into my excruciatingly obvious trap!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Dusk Lobber is yet another shadow plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}On its own, it lobs exploding projectiles.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}In its powered state, however, it lobs down three lanes!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That's a lane for each of my thumbs and noses!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Escape Root is a tricky plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}When threatened, it swaps in an explosive plant!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}And if you tap it, and then another plant, they will switch places!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}You can use Escape Roots to rescue endangered plants!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Whaaaaa-? Plants can be in-dangered? CALL THE POLICE!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Moonflower emits sun, User Dave. But that is not all.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}My scans show that it creates a special glow that augments plants of its type.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Planting Moonflowers next to each other should increase their power.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I suspect they will have the same effect on any other shadow plants we may find. 

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}TACOOOOOOOO!!!

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} Data shows this is a new vortex black hole caused by chaotic temporal fluctuations in the spacetime channel.  

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave} A black hole? Plants always need to dig a hole in the soil to take root and sprout.  

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_4]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} You're not wrong, Dave, but according to the data, this isn't connecting to a giant plant-it's leading to a new universe.  

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_5]

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon} A talking car made of scrap metal? Looks like this other-universe guy still lacks artistic taste.  

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} Enough nonsense, Handsome Zomboss! About you stealing the treasure wig from the Mini Fossil Museum-I won't let it slide!  

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_4]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon} It seems this disruption hasn't given you any decent help. You should take better care of your face!  

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_5]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} It's because you stole the wig! You've destabilized the parallel worlds! I will catch you!  

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_TUTORIAL_1]

{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} 帅哥僵博先生，请问我们要怎么回去呢！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_7]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon} 白痴！本少爷绝不会告诉你！引起这场骚乱的就是本少爷！也绝不会告诉你！回去的关键就是本少爷睿智的假发！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_8]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} 就算你不告诉我！我也会自己查清楚！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_9]

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_2]

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} ......也只能照做了，先抓住帅哥僵博，把假发弄回去吧.....

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_1]

[TWINSHONEYSUCKLE_FAMILY]
忍冬科
[TWINSHONEYSUCKLE_GENUS]
忍冬属
[TWINSHONEYSUCKLE_PEDIA]
金银花：藤蔓上的日月双花
    常绿或半常绿缠绕藤本。
    茎蔓长可达10米；叶片对生，卵形至矩圆状卵形；花朵花通常成对生于腋生的总花梗顶端（称为“双花”），花冠筒状二唇形，初开为白色，2-3天后渐变为黄色，故称“金银花”，具淡雅清香；果实球形，成熟时蓝黑色。花期4-6月（秋季亦常开花），果期8-11月。
    因其冬季叶片不凋落的特性，又名“忍冬”（《中国植物志》选用的中文名）。原产中国、日本和朝鲜半岛，我国大多省份均有分布，常见于山坡、林缘、篱笆等处，而在北美洲被引进后逸生成为难除的杂草。其花蕾具清热解毒、消炎退肿功效，为“双黄连口服液”“银翘散”等核心成分，晒干可做花茶，茎藤称“忍冬藤”，也供药用。
    花语：双生不离


[DRACAENA_FAMILY]
天门冬科
[DRACAENA_GENUS]
龙血树属
[DRACAENA_PEDIA]
剑叶龙血树：石缝中的生命树
    常绿乔木。
    高可达15米；茎粗大，分枝多；叶聚生在茎、枝顶，叶片剑形，薄革质；圆锥花序，花小，乳白色；果实为球形浆果，成熟时橙红色，内含1-3粒种子。花期3月，果期7-8月。
    因其树皮被割破时，分泌的树脂氧化后呈现类似血液的色泽，古人视为“龙血”而得名。干燥后的树脂为中药“血竭”（别名麒麟竭），传统医学认为其具有活血散瘀、止血生肌等功效。原生于中国云南、广西及越南、老挝等地的石灰岩山地，垂直分布于海拔950-1700米，其根系能分泌酸性物质帮助吸收岩矿养分，展现出强大的环境适应力。云南傣族称其为“埋嘎筛”，意为“石缝中的生命树”。在西方，龙血树脂曾被视为神秘材料，用于染料和药剂以及巫术仪式，寄托了人类对自然力量的敬畏。
    花语：坚韧与重生


[RAPEFLOWER_FAMILY]
十字花科
[RAPEFLOWER_GENUS]
芸薹属
[RAPEFLOWER_PEDIA]
油菜：大地的黄金诗行
     一至二年生草本。
    株高可达1.5米；茎直立，分枝性强，稍带粉霜；基生叶羽状深裂，形似莲花座；茎生叶披针形，无叶柄抱茎而生；总状花序在花期成伞房状，花瓣黄色，4枚呈十字形展开；果实为细长角果。 花期3-4月，果期5月。
    嫩叶可食，古称“芸薹”（《中国植物志》中的中文名），种子含油率约40％，为主要油料植物之一，因此得名“油菜”。原产于地中海沿岸与西亚，汉代经丝绸之路传入中国。现全球广泛种植，中国长江流域为最大产区，占世界总产1/4。油菜花田是早春重要的蜜源植物，为传粉网络提供关键生态支持；其根系分泌的硫苷类化合物能有效抑制土传病原菌，与水稻等作物轮作可降低后续作物的化肥需求。
    花语：平凡者的灿烂”、丰收和希望


[DEODARCEDAR_FAMILY]
松科
[DEODARCEDAR_GENUS]
雪松属
[DEODARCEDAR_PEDIA]
雪松：喜马拉雅山上的来客
    常绿大乔木。
    树高可达50米，胸径3米；树冠幼时呈尖塔形，树皮裂成不规则的鳞片；针叶硬质，三棱形，簇生于短枝顶端；雌雄同株，雄球花长卵圆形，雌球花卵圆形；球果成熟前淡绿色，熟时红褐色，种子近三角状，种翅宽大。我国各地栽培的雪松，雄球花常于第一年秋末抽出，次年早春较雌球花约早一周开放，经人工授粉后，种子能正常发育，球果第二年10月成熟。
    雪松因其针叶表皮被蜡质，在阳光下呈现银白色光泽，远观如披薄雪而得名。原生分布于喜马拉雅山脉西北部至阿富汗一带，在我国长江流域及北方多地作为景观树广泛栽培。其木材坚实致密，可作建筑、桥梁、造船、家具及器具等用。


[OLIVE_FAMILY]
木犀科
[OLIVE_GENUS]
橄榄属
[OLIVE_PEDIA]
橄榄：地中海阳光的绿色凝萃
    常绿小乔木。
    高可达10米；树皮灰色；叶革质，披针形，对生，叶面深绿，叶背密被银灰色鳞片；圆锥花序腋生或顶生，花芳香，白色；果椭圆形，成熟时呈紫黑色。花期：地中海气候区4-5月，中国5-6月；果期：10月至次年2月，需霜冻催化油脂积累。
    “橄榄”源于古波斯语“zaytūn”（“油果”），经丝路传入后音译得名；《中国植物志》的中文名为“木犀榄”以别与橄榄科的橄榄。可能原产于小亚细亚，后广栽于地中海地区，现全球亚热带地区都有栽培。其果肉可榨油即橄榄油，因富含不饱和脂肪酸而被WHO列为健康油脂标杆。《圣经》诺亚方舟故事中，鸽子衔回橄榄枝预示灾难结束；希腊神话中，雅典娜以橄榄树赢得雅典守护神之位，因此象征“和平与胜利”，故奥运会上的冠军花环均用橄榄枝编制。
    花语：和平与胜利


[ELECTRICITEA_FAMILY]
山茶科
[ELECTRICITEA_GENUS]
山茶属
[ELECTRICITEA_PEDIA]
茶：东方树叶的生命密码
    常绿灌木或小乔木。
    高1-3米，野生种可达10米；叶革质，长圆形或椭圆形，边缘有锯齿；花1-3朵腋生，白色，花瓣5-6枚，雄蕊多数，雌蕊单生，柱头3裂；蒴果3球形，成熟时裂开。花期为10月至翌年2月，果实次年秋季成熟，但人工茶园多修剪控制结果。
    “茶”字源于巴蜀古方言“槚”（jiǎ），唐代陆羽《茶经》统一称“茶”。绿茶因杀青工艺（高温钝化酶活性）保留叶绿素得名，与发酵茶（红茶、乌龙茶）形成对比。其野生种遍见于长江以南各省的山区，现广泛种植于北纬18°-37°的亚热带山地，栽培品种毛被及叶型变化大。
    花语：谦逊的馈赠


[HYDROCOTYLEDRUMMER_FAMILY]
五加科
[HYDROCOTYLEDRUMMER_GENUS]
天胡荽属
[HYDROCOTYLEDRUMMER_PEDIA]
野天胡荽：湿地的绿色铜钱草
    多年生草本。
    茎细长匍匐，节处生根；叶片圆形或肾形，直径1-4厘米，边缘浅裂呈波浪状，形似迷你香菇伞盖，叶面光滑；伞形花序腋生，小花白色或淡绿色，花瓣5枚；果实为双悬果，扁圆形，表面具纵棱。花期5-8月，果期8-10月。
    因其圆形叶片形似铜钱，民间俗称“铜钱草”，亦像香菇菌盖又名“香菇草”。原产欧洲、北非及西亚的溪边湿地，18世纪作为观赏植物引入东亚。其能快速覆盖水域表面，减少水土流失，其根系可吸收水体过剩氮磷元素，对富营养化水域的藻类繁殖具有抑制作用。但其入侵性强，在北美、澳洲等地已形成生态威胁。人工栽培时需设置物理隔离带，定期修剪避免种子扩散。
    花语：随遇而安、聚财纳福、和谐圆满


[ALOES_FAMILY]
阿福花科
[ALOES_GENUS]
芦荟属
[ALOES_PEDIA]
芦荟：沙漠中的绿色医生
    多年生肉质草本。
    剑形叶片呈莲座状排列，表面覆盖蜡质角质层，能有效反射强烈阳光并减少水分蒸发。叶片内部充满透明凝胶状组织，可储存大量水分，使其在极端干旱条件下存活数月。光合作用采用景天酸代谢（CAM）途径，夜间吸收二氧化碳来减少水分流失。叶边缘的刺既有防御功能，又能收集夜间空气中的冷凝水。总状花序，花橙黄色；蒴果呈三棱柱形，成熟后裂开释放种子。花果期集中在春夏季（5-7月）。
    “芦”喻其叶似芦苇丛生，“荟”取“聚集”之意（宋《开宝本草》）。原产于阿拉伯半岛及非洲东北部干旱地区，古埃及人发现芦荟的凝胶状汁液具有强大的防腐和修复作用，用作外伤治疗和制作木乃伊的防腐剂，称其为“不朽之血”，据传埃及艳后克里奥帕特拉还将芦荟汁作为护肤品和防晒剂。现广布全球热带、亚热带地区，中国福建、云南等地大量栽培，用作观赏及药用。
    花语：洁身自爱、不受干扰


[NARCISSUSSHOOTER_FAMILY]
石蒜科
[NARCISSUSSHOOTER_GENUS]
水仙属
[NARCISSUSSHOOTER_PEDIA]
水仙：冬日自恋的“凌波仙子”
    多年生草本植物。
    株高约40厘米；鳞茎卵球形；叶基生，长带状；伞形花序顶生，3-8朵花，具淡雅清香；花瓣6片，白色，中心具杯状金黄色副花冠；雄蕊6枚，雌蕊单生。副花冠既能形成物理屏障保护花蕊，鲜艳的颜色又能吸引传粉昆虫。此外，水仙属不同物种的副花冠形态各异，帮助其吸引不同的传粉昆虫，实现资源分割。蒴果室背开裂，种子近球形。花果期为12月至翌年3月。
    原产于地中海沿岸，约唐代经丝绸之路传入中国，现见浙江、福建沿海岛屿。作为我国冬季室内水培花卉代表，因其清丽脱俗而被誉为“凌波仙子”。西方神话中，绝美少年Narcissus痴恋水中自己倒影，终日枯坐池畔而亡化为了水仙花，因此水仙花和“自恋”同名为“Narcissus”。其鳞茎有毒，含生物碱可提取药用成分。国内所见多为三倍体栽培品种，难自然结实，以鳞茎分株繁殖。
    花语：思念与纯洁（中国），自恋与重生（西方）。


[TULIPTRUMPETER_FAMILY]
百合科
[TULIPTRUMPETER_GENUS]
郁金香属
[TULIPTRUMPETER_PEDIA]
郁金香：春日的绚烂号手
    多年生草本植物。
    株高约50厘米，具卵球形鳞茎；叶3-5枚，披针形；花单生于茎顶，花瓣6片，形似高脚杯，花色丰富；蒴果圆柱状，有三棱，成熟时开裂，种子扁平。因所见皆园艺品种，需用鳞茎分株繁殖才能保留亲本的观赏性状。花果期为春季。
    原产于中亚及地中海沿岸，其名“Tulip”源于土耳其语“Tülbent”（头巾），因其杯状花型与其相似。16世纪经土耳其传入欧洲，后由荷兰发扬光大，引进我国时因形似姜科的郁金而得名。在17世纪荷兰“郁金香狂热”中，稀有品种的球茎价格堪比豪宅，成为史上首个经济泡沫案例。现为荷兰国花及主要经济作物，为世界春季常用观赏花卉。其鳞茎含少量生物碱可入药，有毒勿自行食用。
    花语：炽热的爱(红色)、永恒的深情（紫色）、失恋后的新生（白色）、阳光与友谊（黄色）


[PASSIONFLOWER_FAMILY]
西番莲科
[PASSIONFLOWER_GENUS]
西番莲属
[PASSIONFLOWER_PEDIA]
西番莲：热带藤蔓上的奇迹之花
    多年生常绿草质藤本植物。
    茎圆柱形，具卷须，可攀附至数米高；叶片掌状5深裂；花朵与卷须对生；萼片和花瓣各5枚，淡绿色；外副花冠裂片3轮，丝状，内副花冠流苏状；雌雄蕊基部合生形成雌雄蕊柄，雄蕊5枚，子房卵圆球形，花柱3枚，紫红色；浆果卵圆形，成熟时橙黄色或紫红色。花期5-7月；果期因品种而异。
    原产于南美洲，约17世纪经欧洲传入中国，又因花形似莲而得名“西番莲”。其属学名为“Passiflora”，源自拉丁语“flospassionis”（耶稣受难之花），因17世纪在南美洲的西班牙牧师传教士将其花朵结构代表基督受难的各种象征。现广泛分布于全球热带及亚热带地，中国广西、云南、广东等地已规模化引种栽培，偶见逸生于湿润山林。其花大而奇特，可作庭园观赏植物；全草可入药，具有祛风消热等功效。
    花语：虔诚之心，憧憬


[LOTUSSHOOTER_FAMILY]
莲科
[LOTUSSHOOTER_GENUS]
莲属
[LOTUSSHOOTER_PEDIA]
藕：淤泥中的白玉走廊
    藕是莲（俗称荷花）的地下茎，呈圆柱形，节部缢缩，上生黑色鳞叶，下生须状不定根。具放射状通气孔道适应水下缺氧环境。其断裂时会有“藕断丝连”的现象，拉出的丝为导管壁的螺纹状纤维，主要起支持导管的作用。秋冬成熟的藕长可达1.5米，重达5公斤，淀粉含量高达20%，堪称“水下粮仓”。虽可用莲子繁殖，但农业生产多采用藕节顶芽进行无性繁殖，保留品种优良性状。
    “藕”取“草”字头与“耦”（双生之意），暗喻其节节相连。我国食用藕的历史悠久，早在新石器时代河姆渡遗址已发现碳化藕粉。因“藕”与“偶”谐音，寓意“佳偶天成”，常用于婚庆仪式中。而在水域生态中，藕的根状茎网络可稳定底泥、吸收沉积物中的营养盐，减少水体富营养化；其孔道结构促进水体-底泥间的氧气交换，为鱼虾等水生动物改善栖息环境。


[WITCHHAZEL_FAMILY]
金缕梅科
[WITCHHAZEL_GENUS]
金缕梅属
[WITCHHAZEL_PEDIA]
金缕梅：古老的魔法护肤精灵
    落叶灌木或小乔木。
    高可达8米；嫩枝有星状绒毛；叶宽倒卵圆形，边缘具波状锯齿；花数朵形成头状或短穗状花序，花瓣4枚，黄色带状。蒴果卵圆形，成熟时果皮暴裂将种子弹射出去，完成种子传播。花期12月至翌年3月，果期9-11月。
    因花瓣如金丝缕、冬季绽放远观似蜡梅而得名。原产中国长江流域的中海拔次生林或灌丛中，是我国特有的第三纪孑遗植物。它的英文名为“Chinese Witch Hazel”，因美洲原住民会用当地的北美金缕梅用于占卜（Witch）和皮肤消炎（现仍是众多护肤品牌青睐的成分），其叶形似榛树（Hazel）。作为极少数冬季开花的温带植物，金缕梅为早春前的传粉昆虫提供珍贵蜜源，维系生态链的连续性。
    花语：灵感，抚慰伤痕


[CACTUS_FAMILY]
仙人掌科
[CACTUS_GENUS]
仙人掌属
[CACTUS_PEDIA]
仙人掌：荒漠中的生存大师
    丛生肉质灌木。
    作为沙漠植物的代表，演化出独特的抗旱结构：肉质茎替代叶片进行光合作用，肥厚的茎部充满储水组织，表面覆盖蜡质层以减少水分蒸发；叶片退化形成刺，既可防御动物啃食，又能遮挡烈日、凝结露水。光合作用采用景天酸代谢（CAM）途径，白天关闭气孔防止水分蒸发，夜间才打开气孔吸收二氧化碳，极大提升水分利用效率。花朵常生于茎顶，色彩艳丽；浆果倒卵球形，顶端凹陷，多汁而吸引动物取食帮其传播种子。花果期为6-10（-12)月。
    “仙人掌”源于其形态似神话中仙人的手掌得名，原产美洲，从加拿大至阿根廷均有分布，墨西哥为多样性中心（占全球1/3种类）。它是干旱区的“生命绿洲”：其茎为蜥蜴、鸟类提供荫蔽，花朵支撑传粉网络，果实滋养动物。枯死后木质化骨架仍可固沙，防止荒漠扩张。16世纪大航海时代后，被引种至非洲、澳洲等地，部分归化为入侵物种。我国于明末引种，栽培用作观赏或围篱，部分地区逸为野生。
    花语：坚韧与希望、隐忍守护的爱情、孤勇者的浪漫


[ROSESWORDMAN_FAMILY]

花烛：热情的“红掌”
    多年生常绿草本植物。
    叶片自基部簇生，呈长圆状心形；花序基部为心形革质苞片，因其颜色鲜红而名佛焰苞（天南星科植物典型特征），现亦有粉、白、绿等栽培品种，中央直立肉穗花序，密布微小花朵，雌雄异花异熟，雌花（基部）先成熟，雄花（顶部）后熟，避免自花授粉，促进异交；果实为球形浆果。自然花果期以春夏为主，温室栽培可全年开花。
    因花序形态似蜡烛而得名，其属名“Anthurium”源自希腊语“anthos（花）+oura（尾巴）”，故有音译名“安祖花”，另有红掌、火鹤花等别名。原产于南美洲热带雨林，现广植于全球热带及亚热带地区。在中南美原住民文化中，红掌被视作热情与生命的象征，常用于宗教仪式。我国多作室内观赏栽培，亦为热门年宵花卉，需注意植株汁液含微毒，避免误食或直接接触汁液引发过敏反应。

[RAFFLESIA_FAMILY]
大花草科
[RAFFLESIA_GENUS]
大花草属
[RAFFLESIA_PEDIA]
大王花：雨林中的腐艳巨无霸
    花朵直径可达1米，被誉为“世界花王”。 雌雄异株，其花瓣厚实如腐肉，呈暗红色带白色斑点，散发浓烈尸臭来特异性吸引食腐昆虫来传粉。最奇特的是它无根、茎、叶，一生寄生在热带藤本植物（如崖爬藤）体内，仅开花时露出地面。大王花从宿主汲取营养数年，花苞孕育需9个月，开花仅持续5-7天。花朵凋谢后结出网球大小的果实，内含数千种子，由果蝠或松鼠传播。其种子萌发需精准落入宿主根部裂隙，生存率极低，国际自然保护联盟（IUCN）评估显示，已知的42种大王花中，有25种处于濒危状态。
    大王花现中文名又称大花草，原产于印尼苏门答腊、马来半岛等地的低海拔热带雨林。其学名Rafflesia arnoldi 源自其发现者的名字合称，19世纪英国探险家Stamford Raffles与博物学家Joseph Arnold二人于1818年首次科学记录这一物种，让此雨林奇观走向世界。
    花语：独自孤傲


[LOTUSSHOWER_FAMILY]
莲科
[LOTUSSHOWER_GENUS]
莲属
[LOTUSSHOWER_PEDIA]
莲蓬：水泽中的生命摇篮 
    莲蓬是莲（俗称荷花）的花托膨大形成的聚合果。其形似倒置的圆锥，表面密布窝状孔洞，每孔嵌一粒果实，俗称莲子。幼时果皮青绿，成熟黑褐色且变致密坚硬，能够有效隔绝水分、空气和微生物的侵入，极大地减缓了种子内部物质的代谢消耗，使其进入长期休眠状态，是宋代古莲子可休眠千年仍发芽的重要因素。随着莲子的成熟，莲蓬也会逐渐变干枯呈现黑褐色，脱落入水，因其疏松多孔浮力大，如同承载莲子的小船，借水流将其传播出去。
    莲原产亚洲热带至温带水域，中国长江流域、印度恒河平原为原生中心。其幼嫩的莲子可生食或煮食，莲心（胚）可做茶饮。莲蓬因“花开见果”的特性，被赋予“因果同时”“生生不息”的哲学寓意。佛教视其为“莲台”，象征涅槃重生；民间以“莲蓬多子”祈愿子孙绵延。

猪笼草——食虫植物界的“陷阱大师”
    直立或攀援草本。
    株高0.5-2米；叶由叶柄（短近无）、叶片、卷须和捕虫笼构成，因捕虫笼形似猪笼而得名。捕虫笼由瓶状体和笼盖两部分构成，其上密布能分泌蜜露的紫红色斑点，瓶口尤其密集，因此能吸引昆虫来到瓶口，一不小心就滑落瓶内，被瓶底分泌的消化液淹死并分解成营养物质，逐渐消化吸收。笼盖可以防止雨水进入笼中，避免稀释笼中消化液的浓度。其花序总状，雌雄异花，花红至紫红色。花期4-11月，果期8-12月。
    猪笼草主要分布于热带地区的沼泽、路边、山中林下等，因其独特的形态和食虫习性，常被作为观赏植物栽培。此外，在东南亚地区，会将米、肉等食材塞入苹果猪笼草的捕虫笼蒸熟做成“猪笼草饭”；干燥的茎叶入药有清热止咳、利尿降压之效。

    辣椒因其茄科植物属性与辛味特征而得名，原产美洲热带地区，最早由南美洲至中美洲一带的古代原住民（约公元前5000年）驯化。16世纪随哥伦布船队传入欧洲，明代中后期（16世纪末）经葡萄牙商船通过海路传入中国，现世界各地广泛种植，在我国众多地区（尤其西南地区）为不可或缺的蔬菜和调味品。辣椒的辛辣感主要来自辣椒素类化合物（辣椒素和二氢辣椒素占90%以上），这些化合物集中在辣椒内部的胎座（白色脉络）和种子周围的腺体中。辣椒素是植物界的“化学武器”：哺乳动物咀嚼果实会因灼痛放弃，而鸟类对辣椒素无感，吞食后完整排出种子，实现高效传播。人类“嗜辣”实属进化意外——痛觉受体TRPV1被激活后释放内啡肽，形成“良性自虐”。农业上，辣椒与玉米、豆类间作可减少虫害，根系分泌物抑制土壤病原菌。

蘑菇——森林隐秘的分解者
    蘑菇是大型真菌的繁殖器官，典型结构（子实体）包括菌盖、菌柄和产孢结构（菌褶/菌管/菌针等）。菌盖形态多样：除伞菌目的典型伞状结构外，还有球状、半球形、漏斗状、蜂窝状等；菌褶或菌管的内侧密布担子/子囊等产孢结构，成熟时单个菌盖每日可释放数亿至万亿孢子。地下菌丝网络（菌丝体）可与一些植物根系形成菌根共生体，通过菌丝桥实现跨物种养分交换与生物电信号传递。其生命周期主要分为营养生长期（菌丝扩展）和生殖生长期（子实体形成）。在温带地区，子实体多在夏秋季节雨后出现；在热带地区，则常见于雨季。从菌丝体分化出原基到子实体成熟，通常仅需3-7天。
    蘑菇全球分布，从极地到雨林均有踪迹。其名可能源于蒙古语“moku”的音译，作为分解者，蘑菇分泌木质素降解酶，将枯木、落叶转化为腐殖质，维系森林物质循环。

    榴莲也写作榴梿，源自马来语“durian”的音译，亦有传说与郑和下西洋相关：船员因留恋其美味而称其为“留恋”，后演变为“榴莲”。原产于马来群岛，主产于泰国、马来西亚、印度尼西亚等东南亚国家，中国广东、海南、云南等地也有引种。在东南亚，榴莲被尊为“水果之王”，既是宗教供品，又因气味争议被部分公共场所禁止携带。榴莲果肉富含蛋白质、维生素C、钾等营养素，兼具药用价值，可缓解痛经、改善体寒。其果壳与果核可炖汤，民间有“一只榴莲三只鸡”的滋补说法。

[COTTONYETI_FAMILY]
锦葵科
[COTTONYETI_GENUS]
棉属
[COTTONYETI_PEDIA]
棉花——大自然的“白色黄金”
    棉花是锦葵科棉属植物的统称，全球广泛栽培的四种棉，为陆地棉、海岛棉、树棉（俗称“亚洲棉”）和草棉，其中陆地棉种植最广。其植株通常高1-2米；叶片呈掌状分裂，具3-5裂片，表面被柔毛；花朵单生于叶腋，初开乳白色，逐渐转为粉红或紫红色；果实为蒴果（俗称“棉铃”），成熟后裂开，露出露出柔软的白色纤维（俗称“棉絮”），包裹着黑色种子 。花果期为夏秋季。
    因棉花纤维似丝绵但来自植物（“木”）而得“棉”字。我国古代主要栽培纤维粗短的俗称“粗绒棉”的树棉（原产印度，汉代传入）和草棉（原产阿拉伯和小亚细亚，南北朝时期传入）。19世纪末陆地棉（原产美洲墨西哥）通过美国传教士引入我国，新中国成立后，因其高产、纤维长（“细绒棉”）而逐步替代了树棉和草棉，占我国棉花总产量的95%以上，主产区为新疆、黄淮海平原等。而海岛棉原产南美热带和西印度群岛，20世纪50年代从苏联、埃及等国引入新疆试种，因其对热量要求高，仅能在新疆南部小规模种植。其纤维极长（“长绒棉”），品质优异，但产量低，主要用于高端纺织。

[PINECONE_GENUS]
松属
[PINECONE_PEDIA]
松果——可开可合的天然湿度计
    松果是松科植物（如红松、油松、华山松）的雌球果。成熟松果呈卵圆形或圆柱形，长3-20厘米不等，表面覆盖木质化鳞片，呈螺旋状排列。每枚鳞片内侧藏两粒带翅种子，干燥时鳞片张开释放种子，潮湿时闭合保护。这样的开合机制确保种子在最佳环境传播，民间也因此曾用它作简易湿度计。松科植物为雌雄同株裸子植物，雄球花春末散发黄色花粉，依赖风力传播；雌球花授粉后需1-3年发育成熟，北半球寒温带至亚热带均有分布。
    松果可为松鼠、交嘴雀提供食物，昆虫幼虫寄生鳞片间，枯落松果成为蚂蚁巢穴建材。古罗马以松果装饰酒神杖，象征生命力；北欧神话中，松果是雷神之锤的化身；佛教法器“金刚杵”顶部造型亦源于松果，寓意智慧开悟。

Ice Hockey Match

[PVZ_WORLDCUP_DES]
Gameplay Overview:
· A large number of zombies will appear in the game, among which zombies with a ball possession mark on their heads will score a goal when they reach our baseline.
· Players play as the plant side, set up formations, and after setting up the formation, plants that kill zombies with ball possession marks will gain ball possession plants food. Dragging the ice hockey plants food onto plants with ball possession marks will shoot the soccer ball.
· Dragging plants food onto plants without ball possession marks will pass the ball to the plant before shooting.
· The ice hockey continues to advance without zombie obstruction or killing zombies. If it advances to the baseline, the player scores one point.
· After the time is up, the side with more goals wins. In case of a draw, players can challenge again.
· Completing levels will earn rich rewards!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! Where are we? My stomach is growling again!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Welcome to the Steam era! This is the 14th stop of our journey through time and space.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Strange smell! The smoke coming out of these holes doesn't smell like food at all!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows that these holes emit toxic gas that can harm plants.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Ahhhhh! These holes are so deep! I'm getting vertigo just looking down!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE}It is said that the depth of these holes reaches 6666 meters.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} Maybe after a while, something will come out of it.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_8]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}There will certainly be nothing else in the hole! Who'll live in such a deep hole!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE} But our detection instruments don't think so.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE} Using flat-top mushrooms can block the opening of the hole and temporarily prevent poisonous mist and zombies from coming out.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}There's a gentleman like me!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} This is a gentleman zombie in the Steam age.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} hey hey! Feeling the feeling of being able to make friends with him!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Gentleman zombies will cause damage to the rear plants by crossing the carnivorous shield plant.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses blowing vibranium to blow off the gentleman's zombie umbrella and let it lose its special skills.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} These many guys with parts in their hands! Are they working seriously?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} is certainly not, these should be zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Where is the kitchen here? I want to go and see the food that is not delicious!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} I don't know if there is a kitchen! But you need a power shooter to attack these zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} lotus root shooter is a powerful long-range output in the Steam Age. It can not only absorb poisonous mist but also cause damage to zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I have an intensive phobia! So many holes!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows that plants or zombies will drill out of the hole.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave} Is there a spring bed in the hole?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}This is not.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} If you use a hammer to hit zombies, you will get points. If you hit plants, you will deduct points. If you reach a certain score, you can pass the level.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE} consumes gold coins to get a doubling hammer, and hitting zombies can get double points.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} consumes diamonds to get a no-error double hammer, and you can get double points by hitting zombies and plants.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Is there a guy with a boiler on his back who is losing weight?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's boiler zombies that explode after a while.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Let me ask him if he can carry such a heavy thing without getting tired?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Theoretically he won't feel tired.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Using ice plants can delay the explosion time of zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} There is a guy coming over pushing a car! Surely there are plenty of good snacks on it!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that it is a coal miner zombie.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} eh? Do those black ones seem to be inked corn rolls? New variety?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those are not ink but coal that bury zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} can burn coal using fire plants!

{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! It looks like a place with lots of taco!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is the 13th century, Europe full of literary and artistic atmosphere.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us in the museum.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} See if the collars of those guys look like corn rolls, maybe they also like to eat corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} I don't know if they like corn rolls, but they definitely still like brains the most.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What are those round things? Uh! New taco, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the Vitruvian ring. If you use the ring rationally, it will become a secret weapon against zombies!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} winter melon guards can help us use secret weapons.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What are those arrows on the ground? As if to say there's a corn roll in front!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE}The arrow on the ground determines the rolling direction of the ring.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} ah ah ah ah oh my God! The fog here almost made me unable to open my eyes!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Our detector shows that these fogs are poisonous, be careful!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at that guy holding a bottle in his hand. Could it be a corn roll-flavored drink!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's a perfumer zombie, and the bottle in his hand can create poisonous mist that can cause damage to plants.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! This damn poisonous fog, I'm almost suffocating!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} We need a plant that can purify poisonous mist!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Aloe vera doctors can purify poisonous mist made by perfumers and increase the attack power of plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I saw a lot of incredible statues, it was so interesting! Lol!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they're definitely because of stealing the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to break them up during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Beware of nightfall.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What's a guy there that looks like he's carving?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the Sculptor Zombie, which can carve rough stones into zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} looks very interesting, I think I also have the talent to become a sculptor!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that your figure has reduced the success rate by 99.9999.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Destroying the rough stone in advance can prevent sculptor zombies from carving out zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Those guys, the clothes they wear are so strange, they don't walk well! I bet they must be drunk!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the ballet zombies, they always appear in groups of four.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} What a terrible setting, will four people need to share the same corn roll? If so, I would rather appear alone......

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses olives to stop fast-moving ballet zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to use tools to solve them during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they must've eaten the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}The number of attention tools is limited.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! Here's what looks like a lot of mustard-flavored corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is 10th century, Heian period Japan.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us at a shrine near Mount Fuji.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at the hairstyles of those guys that look like corn rolls. I'm not sure they really have corn rolls hidden in their hair!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} According to scan analysis, there are no corn rolls hidden in their hair, and they all wear wigs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What's that box there? Uh! A lunch box with tornadoes, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the money box. Reasonable use of different money boxes will help you deal with zombies better!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} Of course, you have to put coins into it first. Oh, I mean your plants food

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE} sun Competition Cash Box can return part of the sun planted in nearby plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh my God! They have a chimney in their hand, and they're gonna fire!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} warns, that's a fireworks zombie, and the sprayed fireworks will light us up!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Wow! This hot feeling, did they add chili sauce to it?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} The water droplets of ice lotus can extinguish the fireworks flames ejected by the fireworks tube.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Then what are you waiting for, quick!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! It's an unusual money box for a race, will it have a corn roll in it this time?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Pay attention to the pattern on the money box. This is the energy money box, which allows nearby plants to release their ultimate moves together.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Is there any other case? I wish I had a case that would hold a taco!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dear Dave, forget about the corn rolls for now. This is the plant race cash box,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} can provide you with a high-level plant to help you solve powerful zombies.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Those guys have a lot in their hands! Is this coming to give a gift?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Please be careful, they are ninja kid zombies, holding pufferfish in their hands, alive!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} What do these guys want to do? I bet they must be because I want to steal my tacos!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} The probability of this possibility is 0.01%. At the same time, the information showed that they were experts in the sneak attack.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} But we have Qianjin Teng, who is an expert in dealing with this kind of ninja.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Uh, again a different box. No taco in it anyway.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Yes, this is a jumping money box that can elevate nearby plants and zombies to the first level, please use it carefully.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What do you smell? Corn rolls are ten thousand times more fragrant than this thing!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dave, I don't have a nose, and secondly it's the sushi chef zombie, who makes quite delicious sushi,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} makes it more difficult for other zombies to eat.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} However, Pyo Ran is a super chef and is eager to have a gourmet showdown with these sushi chefs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Maybe it's time for us to give way.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Should I ask him to make me a corn roll?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! What a wind! It feels like it's going to blow my pot helmet off!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that strong winds often hit this place, and it may be accompanied by terrible cyclones,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} This has a huge impact on us.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} whoa! Can we fight against the power of nature?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Please use dendrobium, they can block the whirlwind and prevent the plants from being blown away when planted together

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE} can also unite to increase strength.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Those guys, the clothes they wear are so weird, they still have fans in their hands!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I bet they must be hot!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is an Onmyoji zombie, and they have a Tengu fan in their hand. Legend has it that this fan can attract strong winds.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} aha! That would really make everyone feel cool.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_13_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look at them, wearing hats and jars, what are you going to do?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_13_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} has been scanned, it is a raincoat zombie, and the hat can defend against projection attacks,

[GROWTH_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_TITLE]
Growth Pack Description

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY]
Anniversary Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Common zombies appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_DESCRIPTION]
To disguise themselves at the plant's anniversary party, common zombies wear birthday hats. However, because they're made of paper, they lack the defensive capabilities of coneheads.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_FLAG]
Anniversary Flag Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_FLAG_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Marks the arrival of a large wave of anniversary zombies.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_FLAG_DESCRIPTION]
No party is complete without balloons, so the Flag Zombie uses balloons to disguise himself. Later, he spent a long time explaining the difference between this balloon flag and balloon zombies to other zombies, but it's said to have had little effect. So the balloon zombie might also mark the arrival of a large wave of anniversary zombies?

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_GARGANTUAR]
Anniversary Gargantuar Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_GARGANTUAR_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Giant zombies appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_GARGANTUAR_DESCRIPTION]
{KEYWORD}Traits: {STAT} Smashes plants with a power pole.
{KEYWORD} Weakness: {STAT} Drops Imp Zombies when damaged.

{FLAVOR} The giant zombie initially wanted to disguise himself as a gift to sneak into the plant's anniversary party, but later found that gift boxes don't move on their own, so he switched to suspenders.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_PHARAOH]
Anniversary Pharaoh Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_PHARAOH_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Pharaoh zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_PHARAOH_DESCRIPTION]
{KEYWORD} Speed Traits: {STAT} Advances like a hungry tiger.
{KEYWORD} Weakness: {STAT} Nut can block him for a while, but it's safer to use Power Peas to eliminate him.

{FLAVOR}A walking cake? No, that's the Pharaoh zombie. Although cakes are much more fragile than sarcophagi, they still make the Pharaoh zombie stronger. Is it because the Pharaoh gains health by eating cake?

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JUGGLER]
Anniversary Juggler Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JUGGLER_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Juggler zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JUGGLER_DESCRIPTION]
The anniversary juggler zombie can bounce back plant projectiles by spinning rapidly. It is said that he practiced hard for a long time to prevent the cake from flying out during the spin, but wouldn't it be stronger if it did fly out?

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_TROGLOBITE]
Anniversary Troglobite Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_TROGLOBITE_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Troglobite zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_TROGLOBITE_DESCRIPTION]
Compared to the disguise of the anniversary gargantuar zombie, the Troglobite zombie's disguise for common zombies is more thorough, but he forgot to disguise himself.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JETPACK]
Anniversary Jetpack Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JETPACK_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Jetpack zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JETPACK_DESCRIPTION]
{KEYWORD}Traits: {STAT} Can jet-fly through most low-lying plants.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_EASY_LEVEL_DESC_PRIMALSUNFLOWER]
Prismatic grass has good damage abilities, but only if it has enough sun to use as ammunition. The primitive sunflower is up to the job.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_EASY_LEVEL_DESC_ELECTRICBLUEBERRY]
After the electric shock blueberry was raised to level 3, the tracking range was expanded to the entire field. The player can plant electric shock blueberries anywhere on the field, with the plants more freely laid out and able to cope with more types of zombie terrain.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_EASY_LEVEL_DESC_TALLNUT]
After the Tall-nut rises to level 3, death must fall to the right to cause range damage. Although it is impossible to kill giant zombies, it is more than enough to deal with ordinary zombies.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_EASY_LEVEL_DESC_CHOMPER]
Chomper can ignore the zombie's health and swallow small zombies of the same order as themselves in one gulp. They can even swallow some zombies with special abilities, making their abilities useless.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_EASY_LEVEL_DESC_SQUASH]
Squash is capable of causing damage to all zombies within a single grid. If one can manage to bring zombies together at one point, that maximizes the role of the Squash.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_NORMAL_LEVEL_DESC_PRIMALSUNFLOWER] 
The energy tiles transformed from ceramic tiles and radishes can make the plants planted on them release their ultimate moves through linkage, and their auxiliary ability is very strong. But every time planted, the required sun will multiply in order for plants with high sun output to meet the requirements of mass planting.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_NORMAL_LEVEL_DESC_ELECTRICBLUEBERRY]
After the electric shock blueberry rises to level 4, there is a high probability that the planting will directly release plants food , and the planting cooling time is short. So being able to increase the damage by using bulk planting or even shoveling out replanting.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_NORMAL_LEVEL_DESC_TALLNUT]
Fast-moving chickens and ice weasels, by virtue of their speed of movement, easily cross the firepower web of long-range plants. At this point, strong tall nuts are needed to keep them out.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_NORMAL_LEVEL_DESC_CHOMPER]
The Chomper move can blow all the zombies in front of you to the bottom line. With the characteristics of sweet potatoes attracting zombies to wrap lines, it may be able to combine different sparks.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_NORMAL_LEVEL_DESC_SQUASH]
Some zombies have special skills that are remote, capable of hiding behind a zombie colony to attack plants or enhance zombies. At this point a brave plant is needed to break into a zombie position.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_HARD_LEVEL_DESC_PRIMALSUNFLOWER]
The missiles fired from the Earth Star silo not only have high damage, but also the ability to radiate zombies. But as the number of Earthstar silos increases, so does the required sun. At this time, plants with high sun production capacity are needed.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_HARD_LEVEL_DESC_ELECTRICBLUEBERRY]
After the electric shock blueberry rises to level 5, there is a probability that the thunder cloud will be upgraded to a cross thunder cloud, which can cause damage to all zombies in the range, and it is not a problem to deal with swarms of zombies.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_HARD_LEVEL_DESC_TALLNUT]
Tall-nut block the movement of flying zombies, coupled with extremely high health and strong energy bean ultimate armor. No matter how many flying zombies you fight, that's fine.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_HARD_LEVEL_DESC_CHOMPER]
After the Chomper rises to level 5, there is a probability that it will open its mouth and swallow or gnaw all the zombies in the three squares in front, so that it can be easily faced with groups of zombies.

[PENNY_CLASSROOM_HARD_LEVEL_DESC_SQUASH]
Squash becomes invincible after discovering and locking the zombies. Effective for charging attacks against zombies.

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}wow, it seems like an unbearable zombie has emerged.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE2_1]
Be careful about {NPC_ENTER:winnie} that's not good.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE3_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} let me use my favorite pea shooter to attack

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE4_1]
What happened to {NPC_ENTER:crazydave} totally unmoved, what can we do?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}beeps.... The test report is out.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_2]
The report says this is Dr. Zombie's latest masterpiece! You need to find a way to beat the toughness value to beat it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_3]
Now zombies are in a high injury free state, only breaking toughness can cause normal damage to zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_4]
{ SAY:winnie } Yellow strips are the toughness value of zombies, do you see the sign next to the toughness value?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE6_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} I should look at it carefully.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE7_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Using electric energy attributes to reduce toughness each time, you summoned 5 electric peas to try it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE8_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Zombies are in a weak state, and now grab the output! Don't let the zombies come back!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE9_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} call! It's not easy!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} That's it! Plants using corresponding properties when encountering toughness zombies can break toughness values faster!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_2]
{SAY:winnie} According to the reports, there are even higher-level attribute attacks that can inflict more damage on resilience values. I'll leave this exploration to you!

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS1_1]
Be sure Penny looks, how can there be so many magic caps, which one is better for me?

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} beeps ... we seem to be at the scene of the event of "Guess Who I am", and each magic cap seems to have something different under it.

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_2]
{SAY:winnie} Oh? I'm a little curious, let me see.

Elite Mirror Queen Zombie
[ZOMBIE_PLANTWARS_MIRROR_QUEEN_PHASE3_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
The Elite Mirror Queen Zombie has a resilience bar mechanism; physical attacks can reduce its resilience (stunning effects can cause high reductions). Emptying the resilience bar puts the zombie into a weakened state, during which the zombie will not act or attack until the resilience bar is fully restored. While the zombie has resilience, it provides damage absorption limits.

[ZOMBIE_PLANTWARS_MIRROR_QUEEN_PHASE3_DESCRIPTION]
The Mirror Queen Zombie spends a lot of time each day indulging in her reflection. She fantasizes that her reflection is stronger and more beautiful than she is now. One day, the mirror finally responded to the queen's wish.
