[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Woah! Welcome to the jungle!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}User Dave, this is no ordinary jungle. A scan of my records indicates that this is the fabled Lost City.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Historical texts state that the Sun was worshipped here. Resources should be plentiful.\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I suggest that we try planting on the Gold Tiles that we find here.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}They should continuously generate sun as long as they have plants on them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Lost City? This is it Penny! We've found it!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:crazydave}Where else would I find my lost taco, except in a Lost City?\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:winnie}Your continued fixation defies all logic or reason, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Come here seeking adventure, have you?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Unfortunately for you, the Porter Gargantuars are about to ruin your day!\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}They carry imps. Imps! Prepare to become ancient history!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_4]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I wish someone would carry me around in a tiny house!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_16_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}I wish for a lot of things, User Dave. That is not one of them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie} Alert, User Dave! My sensors sense incoming Imp Porters.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Importers? Of fine goods and glassware?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Negative. They pitch tents on Gold Tiles, and the tents spawn zombies.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Imps with bad inTENTs!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate movement incoming from above.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Maybe it's presents. Presents from the sky!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}The chances of that statement being true are statistically irrelevant.\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I believe it to be a new form of zombie threat. We should be cautious of unexpected guests.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Beware, User Dave! I detect trap tiles.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are triggered by zombies, or when you plant on them.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}And then they give you tacos?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_22_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}If you equate tacos with jets of flame and huge boulders, then yes.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}We are facing considerable threats, User Dave. I suggest that we retaliate with tremendous force.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}More forceful! That's it! We'll give them all a stern talking to.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I was referring to the Lava Guava. Its explosive blasts leave behind dangerous magma.\r\n

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That sounds even better! First a stern talking, then some lava!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave. I detect a zombie with a shovel.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Can he dig it?

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}It appears to block incoming shots. We need a way to get projectiles over the shovel.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}I know! TELEKINESIS!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_4_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Try again, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon} Do not think to usurp our discovery of the fabled Lost City!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}I and my zombies have already submitted our find to the Eminent Journal of the Missing and the Mislaid!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}We will publish and you will PERISH!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Look, Penny! A shiny doo-jickey-ma-thing!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate this amulet points the way to a long-lost challenge.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Let’s do some deft discovering!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}All that discovering and still no taco!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:winnie}The search will no doubt continue, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}My discovery remains intact. The taco is still unfound. And your brains will certainly one day be mine!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Well lookie-here, Penny! It's a chest map!

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{SAY:winnie}My analysis suggests that the origins of that map are highly suspect.

[NARRATIVE_LOSTCITY_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:crazydave}It has a big red X on it, Penny. When have big red Xs ever been bad?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY:winnieicon}User Dave, we have encountered a scroll.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}I love side-scrollers! They're my second favorite kind of game.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_3]
{SAY:crazydave}But there are so many unfamiliar symbols here.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_ZOMBIENOTE_4]
{SAY:winnie}Knowledge gives people the ability to judge right from wrong...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}They appear to need our protection!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Let's get to it! After all, bananas are a very a-PEELING fruit!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BANANA_4]
{TIRED:winnie}User Dave, if I had a head, I would be shaking it right now.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My research indicates that the sport of bowling experienced a heyday during this era.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_2]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_3]
{TIRED:winnie}I find your thought process indecipherable, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_4]
{SAY:winnie}I was thinking that Bowling Bulbs would make excellent allies here.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_5]
{SAY:crazydave}Huh. I was thinking how much I love wearing bowling shoes.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_BOWLING_6]
{EXCITED:crazydave}So many colors ... right there on my feet!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}When fighting zombies from the deep...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_2]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}...we need a plant with the appetite of a shark.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}I catch your drift, Penny. You're talking about Chomper!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_4]
{SAY:winnie}Indeed. His sharp teeth could turn the tide of battle.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Hey, I have an idea too! We could call this Chomper Week!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_CHOMPER_6]
{TIRED:winnie}If we must, User Dave. If we must.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_2]
{SAY:crazydave}It's got everything a growing plant needs!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Sun, sand and lots o' water!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_4]
{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave. My sensors indicate there are zombies on your beach...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:winnie}... and far too much water. It will overwhelm the plants.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_6]
{SAY:crazydave}No problem-o! We'll just lay down some Lily Pads.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_7]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Then the other plants can ride the waves!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_8]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}Or as the vernacular of this era goes: They can \

{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}Listen up, dudes! I'm here to totally bum you out.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY}Way down deep, there's a certain creep...

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY}When he swims up, your brains he'll keep!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY}Later losers! Doc Zomboss

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}That dude is totally gnarly.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:winnie}He is also quite unpleasant, User Dave. Quite unpleasant.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}Dudes, like, you're totally in for it now!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_2]
{SAY}The Deep Sea Gargantuars have their slimy sights on you.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_3]
{SAY}You can run! You can swim!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_4]
{SAY}But you can't escape their scaly grip!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Ugh. That dude is totally gnarly.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_ALT_6]
{TIRED:winnie}He is also quite unpleasant, User Dave. Quite unpleasant.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED:crazydave}I tell ya, Penny, these surf-loving zombies are the pits!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_2]
{SAY:winnie}Analyzing the phrase: \

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_3]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}Hmmm. Pits. Very interesting. User Dave! You are a genius!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}I am?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_5]
{TIRED:winnie}No. No you are not. However, you have given me an idea.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_6]
{EXCITED:winnie}Guacodile! This plant fights zombies with pit-like projectiles.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_7]
{SAY:winnie}And he employs a powerful bite as well.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_GUACODILE_8]
{EXCITED:winnie}Plant him on the front lines. You'll see.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED:crazydave}Whew! Fighting zombies that arrive in waves AND tides isn't easy.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}You know what we need, Penny? An ally with a lot of 'tude!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_3]
{SAY:crazydave}And by 'tude, I mean attitude. In case you need translation.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_4]
{SAY:winnie}Then I suggest we call upon Homing Thistle.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_5]
{SAY:winnie}I believe he has this 'tude you speak of.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_6]
{EXCITED:crazydave}His eyes! Intense! He can shoot the zombies a real mean look.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_7]
{EXCITED:winnie}More importantly, he can shoot deadly darts that home in on their target.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_HOMINGTHISTLE_8]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Two painful blows for the price of one! Radical!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}The tide comes in, the tide goes out. Who can explain it?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_TIDES_5]
{TIRED:winnie}That would be science, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]

{SAY:zombossicon}But have you noticed that Chomper and Bikini Zombie have been ultra cozy lately?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Could a beachside plant-zombie romance be in bloom?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Speaking of which, how sure are you of Chomper's loyalties?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]

{SAY:winnie}User Dave, do not jump to conclusions. I suggest something more productive.

{EXCITED:winnie}Let us jump into the action!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:winnie}Alert! I've detected a strange statue of surfing-era significance.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Well lookie there! It's a tiki statue. With crazy eyes.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]

{PLAYFUL:crazydave}So you're saying that a tiki torture awaits? Get it? A tiki TORCH-er?

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]

{SHOUT:crazydave}And I know a thing or two about craaaazy!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:winnie}I concur. I suspect Dr. Zomboss was attempting to sow seeds of discontent.

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:crazydave}From now on, we are the only ones sowing seeds around here!

[NARRATIVE_BEACH_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Totally bogus! Little do you know what I have in store for you!

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I am picking up a grid of plants, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}My scans suggest that they can be swapped to create matches of three.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I saw a game like that once on my telephoney!

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}You can use sun to upgrade the plants.

[NARRATIVE_BEGHOULED_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Make 100 matches to defeat the zombies!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}It took forever to get 'em clean.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}There is no zombie outbreak threatening you.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}You are not using plants to defend your home.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}The zombies and I are normal people, simply trying to help you.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}I bet you'll tell us there are no spoons, too!

{PLAYFUL:crazydave}The Future you say?

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_NEW_OUTRO_LASTTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:crazydave}We should take another look at my Time-Space Taco Map.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}My Uncle Milo used to have one these, he called it a boom box.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}Actually, that's close enough. I'll allow it.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Maybe we can use that to unlock our minds.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}I still have some cleaning to do.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:winnie}It would be better used gaining access to a World.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{TIRED:winnie}You know, for the greater good of...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}The Taco! I almost forgot.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{EXCITED:crazydave}That's right! These plants versus you and your zombies.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:crazydave}And we didn't even use any spoons...

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Even though those things totally exist!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}I admit you are correct in this regard.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}We have no existential conflict over the nature of spoons.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{START_DIALOG_MUSIC}That looks like it could be all futurey.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_10]

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_11]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}

{EXCITED:crazydaveicon}That Mr. Boss guy seems like a really nice fellow!

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_13]
{TIRED:winnieicon}We should be wary of that one User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_COWBOY_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_INTRO_14]
{SAY:winnieicon}In the meantime...

{TIRED:winnie}There are evil potions on the lawn!

{EXCITED:crazydave}Evil medieval potions! They're the most dangerous kind...

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_EVILPOTIONS_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}On account of having twice the evil!

{SAY:winnie}User Dave, the vapours are no longer considered a real ailment.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_3]
{SAY:winnie}But I believe Fume-shroom will be of use here.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_FUMESHROOM_4]
{EXCITED:winnie}His vapors are quite real and provide a distinct advantage against the right zombie opponents.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}According to my data, iron and other metals were routinely put to use during the Dark Ages.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}Thus, Magnet-shroom should make an excellent ally here.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}He can pull buckets, helmets and other metal objects off of zombies!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_MAGNETSHROOM_4]

{PLAYFUL:winnie}What if there was one plant that behaved like both a Pea-shooter AND a Wall-nut?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_5]
{SAY:winnie}We would call it a ... Pea-nut!

{EXCITED:crazydave}Keep talkin' like that and people are going to call you Crazy Penny!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_PEANUT_8]
{SAY:crazydave}Which would be weird for both of us.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Verily, I shall tell thee. It's zombies! Plant food is made out of zombies!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Unpossible! We feed our plants only the highest quality organic uhm...

{TIRED:crazydave}Hey Penny, what is Plant Food made of?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_7]
{SAY:winnie}I fear the true nature of Plant Food requires further analysis, User Dave.

{TIRED:winnie}Excuse me while I run some tests.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]

{TIRED:winnie}I understand it to be a test, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{EXCITED:winnie}Only someone with great physical strength and strength of character may remove it.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_4]
{SAY:crazydave}I bet someone with a jackhammer could remove it.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}A CRAAAZY someone!

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_6]
{TIRED:winnie}An inelegant but no doubt effective solution to the test, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I have found no evidence that Plant Food contains zombies or zombie byproducts.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{TIRED:crazydave}Phew! Plants shouldn't eat zombies who eat plants.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Except Chomper. He has to. Dude needs the fiber.

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}Perchance, a question best left for another day?

[NARRATIVE_DARK_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{SAY:zombossicon}Now, I pray, imagine maniacal laughter as I depart.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Alert, User Dave. My sensors indicate we have moved 153,954,765 years into the past.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Yabbers! That's before I was even born!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_1_INTRO_3]

{EXCITED:crazydave}I know! Gymnosperms, right?

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I was thinking more in terms of saurians, User Dave. Dinosaurs.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}They won't attack us directly and we can't affect them.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}However, they will definitely react to zombies. Be wary!

{EXCITED:crazydave}Zuh? But how? Even Gargantuars get knocked back!

[NARRATIVE_DINO_21_INTRO_4]

{SAY:winnie}Indeed, User Dave. A herd of stegosaurs approaches.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}My sensors indicate they will snare zombies with their tail, and then flick them off.

[NARRATIVE_DINO_6_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That's what I would do!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Regards, Dr. Edgar Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Cool, that Mr. Boss guy wants your autograph!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_6]
{TIRED:winnie}This can't be good.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}My taco tastes so close I can smell it!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:winnie}Beware, User Dave. Dr. Zomboss still stands in our way.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:crazydave}What does that guy have against tacos and me eating them?

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Bah! My reasoning is simple yet beyond your comprehension!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:winnie}Though tetrahedrons are pyramids, this one is not a Platonic solid.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I'm so hungry, I would love a Platonic solid.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{TIRED:winnie}User Dave, this is also not a taco salad.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Look, Penny! A Pirate Key! It's pirate-y!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}This will enable us to travel to another time.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Sounds salty! Taco... ahoyyyy!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL}Wait a minute!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{TIRED:crazydave}There was never any meat in that taco.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I still have Tofunky in my beard to prove it!

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Well, that just leaves more brains for us... later.

[NARRATIVE_EGYPT_WORLDMAP_INTRO_OLD_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{TIRED}No, that is a time-space map to the plants that can help us.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I'm feeding the rhythm, I'M FEEDING THE RHYTHM!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Somebody passed me a note in homeroom, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}It says to meet behind the bike racks at lunchtime for a funderful surprise!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_15_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}I believe some skepticism about this note is in level, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Do you feel that you have grooved? Did you bang your head? Have you \

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_2]

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_3]

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Be brave, User Dave. We'll jilt this ditty... on rock and roll!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Mmm! Penny, do you smell something scrum-dicious?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:Winnie}No, User Dave. Only Breakdancer Zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Maybe they’re garlic-flavored!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}I believe special zombies may display unique abilities while their preferred music is playing.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}You mean they'll jam their jam when their jam is jamming?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Yes, correct, yes, and yes, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Spore-shrooms have a unique ability, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}If they defeat a zombie, a new Spore-shroom will spawn where that zombie fell.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_22_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazyDave}Hey-wah-zoo! Spore-shrooms mean more shrooms!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Say, do you think Intensive Carrots can be used to revive defeated plants?

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}That’s... that’s exactly correct, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_26_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Sorry. It just confuses me when you pay attention.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I got a real Cactus feeling about this, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Indeed, Cactus has changed over time, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Now she fires a thorn for ranged damage, but hides for ground damage when zombies approach.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That's so Cactus... always varying her attack and defensive profiles!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Hmmmm... you’re in danger above. You’re a fool; and so knew I!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Hear me now: Ever shall you give up; ever shall you be down; always you’ll run aground, I’ll revert you.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}I intend to make you cry; I mean for you to say goodbye; I'm not really that nice a guy – I alert you!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_INTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Ouch!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}Yarbs! That was close... with so many exciting timing and rhythm changes!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}I fear we have only hit pause on Dr. Zomboss’s heinous deal.

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_32_OUTRO_3]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Indeed, next verse, same and yet worse! I go now to when you cannot imagine!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Penny! Penny! Penny! A microphone!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Karaoke time! At last my tangerine dreams will come true!

[NARRATIVE_EIGHTIES_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_3]
{SAY:winnie}Caution, User Dave. This dropped mic promises a banned battle of heavy petal proportions! 

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Penny! A grid of plants for swappin'!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Indeed, User Dave. Plants can be swapped to create matches of 3 or more.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}You must make 125 matches to defeat the zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}You can use sun to upgrade your plants.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:winnie}I detect three different Power-Ups, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are Power Shuffle, Power Shovel, and Power Zap.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Power Shuffle scrambles the board if you are having trouble finding a match.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Power Shovel fills in a crater, allowing an eaten plant to be replaced.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_5]
{SAY:winnie}Power Zap power zaps zombies.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_2_INTRO_6]
{SAY:crazydave}I was confused about that last one!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}SO MUCH SWAPPING, PENNY!!!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie} Indeed, it is a gauntlet, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}However, my sensors detect a rich reward if we persevere.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}Keep calm and swap on!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Whew! That plant grid was rough like old sausage!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_BEGHOULED_BLITZ_001_5_OUTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Correct, User Dave. However, we should expect a rich coin reward for our efforts.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Alert, User Dave! My batteries are losing power.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}But you need power to roll your windows up and down!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Correct. Perhaps some electrical plants can restore my charge.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}That's so plausible, it just might work!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:winnie}My batteries are nearly charged, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Wahoo! So many electrons!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}That Electric Currant is sparky AND sparkly!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie} Indeed, its electrical power is most invigorating.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_10_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}It will make an excellent addition to our collection.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I have detected an Electric Currant plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Two in the same row or column will create an electric field between them.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}The field will damage zombies and recharge my batteries.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}What a positive development!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}I detect mine carts, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Use them to zap zombies with Electric Currant fields.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Watt a great idea!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}All this electricity makes my face-beard hurt! Can we stop for a beach break?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Of course, User Dave. Prepare for Beach Party onslaught.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Can we have bananas?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}Bananas will be provided.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave} How are your batteries, Penny?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They are charging nicely, User Dave, thank you for inquiring.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}The Electric Currants are most helpful.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}They sure make a powerful coulomb-ination!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Note the rolling boulders.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_ELECTRICCURRANT_9_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}When triggered they destroy plants and zombies alike.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Attention, User Dave! I have audio-detected a large stash of zombie gems. 

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Heard the horde's hoard, huh?

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}If we move swiftly, we may be able to claim them for our own.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:crazydave}Hi-ho-Gem-Jam, awaaaaay!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Those gems are so close I can smell 'em!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:crazydave}Like gooseberries in springtime!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Hsss! Rascals! Gem-poaching scoundrels!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_10_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}No matter! My plans proceed apace!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The zombies are aware of our gem quest, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}They intend to attack us from the sea.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GEMJAM_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}We'll sea about that! Bowling Bulbs, LET'S ROLL!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}I smell leather! And electricity!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}My sensors register a plant lost in time.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}I smell a rescue! And oranges!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Our missing plant is the Gold Bloom, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}It produces an immediate bounty of sun when planted!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Instant sun? Not good enough! MUST GO FASTER!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Gold Bloom is unstuck in time, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}Luckily I can track it whenever it goes.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_2_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Hang on, little sprout! We're a-comin'!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}We did it! I am a hero to all plants!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}I am concerned about the strange portals we encountered, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie} I believe some unfortunate chicanery may be afoot.

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_4]
{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}HA! HA-HA-HA! HA!

[NARRATIVE_EPIC_QUEST_GOLDBLOOM_7_OUTRO_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}I am amused!

[NARRATIVE_ESCAPEROOT_LOD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Tap the Escape Root, then tap another plant, to make them switch places.

[NARRATIVE_ESCAPEROOT_LOD_2]
{SAY:winnie}Escape Root explodes when a zombie gets close.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_LASTSTAND_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}I like to save some sun for a rainy day.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_LASTSTAND_A_2]
{TIRED:winnie}It can get you out of a pickle or into an E.M.Peach.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY}You can pick your friends, but you can't pick these plants.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_A_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{EXCITED:crazydave}But some of my best friends are plants!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{TIRED}Looks like we don't have much firepower here Penny.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY}With a good supply of sun...

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PRESET_B_3]
{EXCITED:winnie}Magnifying Grass can pack quite the punch.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PROTECTPLANTS_A_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Protect those Citrons!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_CHALLENGE_PROTECTPLANTS_A_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}It takes a lot of pulp to stand your ground like that.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_3]
{TIRED:winnie}...

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_4]
{SAY:crazydave}Hey, what happened to the lawn? It’s so glowy!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_FIRSTLEVEL_5]
{SAY:winnie}I’m detecting an array of Power Tiles on the space-lawn.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY}Welcome back Gardener,

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}In this year your brains were collected ages ago.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Collect them again soon, Dr. Edgar Zomboss.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Watch out neighbor, I'm pretty sure he wasn't talking about my BRAINS!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}I would say there's evidence to the contrary.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}Isn't it convenient that your neighbor is so helpful in your fight against us zombies?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Crazy David's apparent incompetence is only eclipsed by his usefulness.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}However, with one secret word my sleeper agent will turn against you.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{SAY:zombossicon}Listen to me David, \

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SPECIAL1}Hey neighbor!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]
{PLAYFUL}Can I borrow your brains? Um, I mean hot sauce!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MAGNIFYING_GRASS_FAILURE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY}Oops, you should give it another shot!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}You can decide to launch one mower early now.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_2]
{EXCITED:winnie}Just press and hold a mower when the time is right.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_MANUAL_MOWERS_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}Sometimes that's the most strate-logical thing to do!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}I spy with my crazy eye a U.F.B.! An unidentified flying brain!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{SAY:winnie}Something more formidable than a brain lies within.

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{SPECIAL2}Oh! That was...hypno-MAZING!

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}I want to eat THAT hypno-taco again! I need my TIME MACHINE!

{TIRED:crazydave}What? Wait a minute... what was I saying again?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{SAY:zombossicon}Drats, or was it Zombno-Hypsosis?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_ZOMBIENOTE_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{SAY}It says there’s an error.  Can you come here and fix it Penny?

[NARRATIVE_FUTURE_ZOMBIENOTE_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{TIRED}Did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}You mean his ol' Knock 'Em Dead maneuver?

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_CHARDGUARD_6]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}It’ll knock those zombies back where they came from!

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My data suggests Hurrikale would be of great use here.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}A blast of air from him, and the zombies will chill out and slow down!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_HURRIKALE_3]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}The guy's a real blow hard. And I mean that in the nicest way possible.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_ICEBLOCKS_4]

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_MINIGAME_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}{SAY:crazydave}It's too quiet. Where is everyone? I have a bad feeling about this.

{PLAYFUL:winnie}Time to turn up the heat. I recommend Pepper-pult for the job.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Great idea, Penny! That guy's breath is stunning!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_5]
{SAY:crazydave}Not even exaggerating. He stuns zombies ... with his bad breath.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_STUNION_6]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Gross. But also, pretty nifty!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:crazydave}Penny, what we need right now is a nice hot cup o' cocoa!

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_2]
{SAY:winnie}User Dave, that is an unproven zombie-fighting weapon.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_3]
{SAY:winnie}I recommend we call on Rotobaga instead.

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_INTRO_XSHOT_4]
{EXCITED:winnie}She can hover above ground AND shoot at zombies in four directions!

{SAY:winnieicon}Sigh. While your tongue heals, please note the strange stone tablet. 

[NARRATIVE_ICEAGE_ZOMBIENOTE_5]
{SAY:winnieicon}It appears to be a warning sign, written in Cave Zombie.

{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED}That's it. Please disrupt this anomaly before User Dave gets too attached.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED}User Dave, this does not look like a party.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL}It could still be a surprise party, with gifts and everything!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_LEVEL_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave}You'll see Penny, I think these zombies are different.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{EXCITED}There is an impending attack on your house in modern times!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED}I bet it's not an attack... I bet it's a party! Oh, I hope it's a Piñata Party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnieicon}It's not a party, there are zombies from all different time periods ready to strike!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:winnieicon}Who knows what else they could have brought with them?

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_INTRO_5]
{PLAYFUL:crazydaveicon}Sounds like a party to me! Better hurry up, we don't want to miss out!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_MAP_OUTRO_1]

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}{EXCITED}Just let us know of any more Piñata Parties you detect!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_RESET_INTRO_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydaveicon}For a party they can be pretty sneaky.

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}What did I tell you Penny? A surprise Piñata Party!

[NARRATIVE_LOD_REWARD_INTRO_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED}Does not compute. It appears a level 3 diagnostic check is in level.

{EXCITED:crazydave}Piñatas! Let's bust some open and see what we get!

[NARRATIVE_MINIGAME_INTRO_1]

{EXCITED:crazydave}...OOOOOOOO! Sorry, I was busy screaming \

{EXCITED:crazydave}TACOOOOOOO!!!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}We have picked up a Shadow-shroom seed packet, User Dave. 

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie} Shadow-shrooms are shadow plants, so be sure to plant them next to Moonflowers for bonus effects.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_11_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave} Adjacency wins again!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_15_OUTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}No, User Dave! You must not! I detect high levels of trappiness!

{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Fools! You have fallen into my excruciatingly obvious trap!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Dusk Lobber is yet another shadow plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}On its own, it lobs exploding projectiles.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}In its powered state, however, it lobs down three lanes!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:crazydave}That's a lane for each of my thumbs and noses!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}Escape Root is a tricky plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}When threatened, it swaps in an explosive plant!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}And if you tap it, and then another plant, they will switch places!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}You can use Escape Roots to rescue endangered plants!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_19_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}Whaaaaa-? Plants can be in-dangered? CALL THE POLICE!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Moonflower emits sun, User Dave. But that is not all.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}My scans show that it creates a special glow that augments plants of its type.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}Planting Moonflowers next to each other should increase their power.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:winnie}I suspect they will have the same effect on any other shadow plants we may find. 

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:crazydave}TACOOOOOOOO!!!

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}All-Star Zombies are encroaching, User Dave!

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Oy howdy! I think it's one of those Beghouled-y grids again, Penny!

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_23_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Grimrose is a shadow plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_23_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}It drags down a zombie that enters its lane.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_23_INTRO_3]
{SAY:winnie}When powered, it can dispose of three zombies before it expires.

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}The Nightshade is another shadow plant, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:winnie}By itself it deals slapping damage to zombies.

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{SAY:winnie}My sensors are picking up increased helium levels, User Dave.

[NARRATIVE_MODERN_9_INTRO_2]

[NARRATIVE_OUT_OF_CONTENT_FUTURE_NEXT_5]
{SPECIAL16:crazydaveicon}And a taco is what we find inside of all of us.

[NARRATIVE_OUT_OF_CONTENT_SOON_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydaveicon}It may look like the end of the road...

[NARRATIVE_OUT_OF_CONTENT_SOON_10]
{PLAYFUL:crazydaveicon}Could you put it in the fridge?

[NARRATIVE_OUT_OF_CONTENT_SOON_2]
{SAY:crazydaveicon}But the road goes on when searching for a taco on the space-time continuum.

[NARRATIVE_OUT_OF_CONTENT_SOON_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnieicon}{SAY:winnieicon}In the meantime, be sure to practice advanced planting techniques in the Endless Zones.

[NARRATIVE_OUT_OF_CONTENT_SOON_4]

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_INTRO_GARGANTUAR_5]
{TIRED:winnie}We're gonna need a bigger boat.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}I've discovered a mysterious trait in your rattletrap time machine.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Its temporal signature is nearly identical to my own creations.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}Explain to me, how was this \

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{NPC_EXIT:zombossicon}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:winnie}Could I really be some form of Zombot?

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{EXCITED:crazydave}Finally, one of these pirates dropped some booty! 

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_DANGER_ROOM_KEY_2]
{PLAYFUL:winnie}I'm detecting something more challenging than chest inside. 

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie}This will be most useful!

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_2]
{SAY:winnie}With it we can access another World.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_GARGANTUAR_3]
{TIRED:crazydave}Nuts. I was hoping it would make our boat bigger.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{TIRED:winnie}Please, tell me about your creation process.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_2]
{EXCITED:crazydave}It was pretty easy! I found some timey wabby wabbo stuff.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_3]
{SAY:crazydave}Then I put it between two slices of bread...

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_4]
{PLAYFUL:crazydave}BOOM! Awesome sandwich!

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_5]
{NPC_EXIT:winnie}{NPC_EXIT:crazydave}{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Such proliferous bunk. I should have expected as much.

[NARRATIVE_PIRATE_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_6]

{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave} What's this? A vortex I've never seen before?

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} Data shows this is a new vortex black hole caused by chaotic temporal fluctuations in the spacetime channel.

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave} A black hole? Plants always need to dig a hole in the soil to take root and sprout.

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_4]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} You're not wrong, Dave, but according to the data, this isn't connecting to a giant plant-it's leading to a new universe.

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_5]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} Uh-oh, the black hole is releasing a strong gravitational pull! We're being sucked in!

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_6]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave} New-universe-flavored tacos! Here I come!

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon} Let's see what kind of chaos this disturbance has brought me!

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon} A talking car made of scrap metal? Looks like this other-universe guy still lacks artistic taste.

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} Enough nonsense, Handsome Zomboss! About you stealing the chest wig from the Mini Fossil Museum-I won't let it slide!

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_4]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon} It seems this disruption hasn't given you any decent help. You should take better care of your face!

[NARRATIVE_NO42_UNIVERSE_UNCHARTED_EVENT2_TUTORIAL_5]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} It's because you stole the wig! You've destabilized the parallel worlds! I will catch you!

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_TUTORIAL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} Data shows... Universe No. 42 has a 42% similarity with our universe.

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} The plants and zombies here may look the same but have surprising differences.

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} Who's this talking car?

{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} I don't understand half of what you're saying, but whatever, help me deal with Handsome Zomboss! 

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} 这里的植物和僵尸好奇怪啊。

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_2]

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} 希望能抓紧时间找到用户戴夫，找到回去的办法......

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_4]

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_6]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} 帅哥僵博先生，请问我们要怎么回去呢！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_7]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon} 白痴！本少爷绝不会告诉你！引起这场骚乱的就是本少爷！也绝不会告诉你！回去的关键就是本少爷睿智的假发！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_8]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} 就算你不告诉我！我也会自己查清楚！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_MAIN_9]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} 42％的相似度说低不低，说高也不高.....

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} 用户硬汉戴夫，你觉得现在疯狂戴夫人在哪里？

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_2]
{NPC_ENTER:no42crazydave}{PLAYFUL:no42crazydave} 这并不重要！我一定要把帅哥僵博找到！把假发送回博物馆！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_INTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} ......也只能照做了，先抓住帅哥僵博，把假发弄回去吧.....

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_1]
{NPC_ENTER:no42zombossicon}  你们给本少爷等着！本少爷就算没有假发也是如此光鲜亮丽美丽动人！

[NARRATIVE_UNCHARTED_NO42_OUTRO_ZOMBOSS_END_2]

[NARRATIVE_TRANS_GENOSIS_OPEN_TUTORIAL_1]

{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} is full of pumpkin heads and ghosts, so you don't have to guess that Halloween is here

[NARRATIVE_ANNIVERSARY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Actually, I am also a ghost

[NARRATIVE_ANNIVERSARY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_3]

[NARRATIVE_CHILDRENSDAY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_4]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{ EXCITED:crazydave } Oh? Then I'll have to meet him.

[NARRATIVE_NEEDFORSPEED_202406_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_1]

[NARRATIVE_NEEDFORSPEED_202406_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie}Just pick one, and let's have a race to see who's faster!

[NARRATIVE_NEEDFORSPEED_202406_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave}Sure, but after I win, you have to give me one of those cars.

[NARRATIVE_SPRING_FESTIVAL_2024_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} Maybe I can use red envelopes to buy a brand new set of wheels. Wait a minute, have you heard anything?

[NARRATIVE_SPRING_FESTIVAL_2024_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_4]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{EXCITED:crazydave} heard it, it seems that there are many old guys coming to celebrate the Spring Festival with us!

[NARRATIVE_ARBORDAY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie}Spring is finally here, some of my parts are almost moldy, go, go out and bask in the sun

[NARRATIVE_ARBORDAY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_2]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}{PLAYFUL:crazydave}I love spring so much! But it's obviously spring, why is my lawn still freezing

[NARRATIVE_ARBORDAY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_3]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}{PLAYFUL:winnie} My radar shows that those zombies are still outside preparing to launch a new round of attacks

[NARRATIVE_ARBORDAY_UNCHARTED_EVENT_TUTORIAL_4]

It's like eating a tacos, it's too strong!

[NARRATIVE_GENE_ENHANCEMENT_SECOND_1]
{NPC_ENTER:researchercrazydave}{EXCITED:researchercrazydave} This is a gene sequence extractor that I am proud of. It can extract the original gene into a gene sequence that increases the combat effectiveness of plants!

[NARRATIVE_GENE_ENHANCEMENT_THIRD_1]
{NPC_ENTER:researchercrazydave}{EXCITED:researchercrazydave}Now you are a qualified gene editing scientist! Go use the genetic sequence to increase the combat effectiveness of the plant!

[TWINSHONEYSUCKLE_FAMILY]
忍冬科
[TWINSHONEYSUCKLE_GENUS]
忍冬属
[TWINSHONEYSUCKLE_PEDIA]
金银花：藤蔓上的日月双花
    常绿或半常绿缠绕藤本。
    茎蔓长可达10米；叶片对生，卵形至矩圆状卵形；花朵花通常成对生于腋生的总花梗顶端（称为“双花”），花冠筒状二唇形，初开为白色，2-3天后渐变为黄色，故称“金银花”，具淡雅清香；果实球形，成熟时蓝黑色。花期4-6月（秋季亦常开花），果期8-11月。
    因其冬季叶片不凋落的特性，又名“忍冬”（《中国植物志》选用的中文名）。原产中国、日本和朝鲜半岛，我国大多省份均有分布，常见于山坡、林缘、篱笆等处，而在北美洲被引进后逸生成为难除的杂草。其花蕾具清热解毒、消炎退肿功效，为“双黄连口服液”“银翘散”等核心成分，晒干可做花茶，茎藤称“忍冬藤”，也供药用。
    花语：双生不离


[DRACAENA_FAMILY]

    常绿乔木。
    高可达15米；茎粗大，分枝多；叶聚生在茎、枝顶，叶片剑形，薄革质；圆锥花序，花小，乳白色；果实为球形浆果，成熟时橙红色，内含1-3粒种子。花期3月，果期7-8月。
    因其树皮被割破时，分泌的树脂氧化后呈现类似血液的色泽，古人视为“龙血”而得名。干燥后的树脂为中药“血竭”（别名麒麟竭），传统医学认为其具有活血散瘀、止血生肌等功效。原生于中国云南、广西及越南、老挝等地的石灰岩山地，垂直分布于海拔950-1700米，其根系能分泌酸性物质帮助吸收岩矿养分，展现出强大的环境适应力。云南傣族称其为“埋嘎筛”，意为“石缝中的生命树”。在西方，龙血树脂曾被视为神秘材料，用于染料和药剂以及巫术仪式，寄托了人类对自然力量的敬畏。
    花语：坚韧与重生

    嫩叶可食，古称“芸薹”（《中国植物志》中的中文名），种子含油率约40％，为主要油料植物之一，因此得名“油菜”。原产于地中海沿岸与西亚，汉代经丝绸之路传入中国。现全球广泛种植，中国长江流域为最大产区，占世界总产1/4。油菜花田是早春重要的蜜源植物，为传粉网络提供关键生态支持；其根系分泌的硫苷类化合物能有效抑制土传病原菌，与水稻等作物轮作可降低后续作物的化肥需求。

[RAFFLESIA_GENUS]
大花草属
[RAFFLESIA_PEDIA]
大王花：雨林中的腐艳巨无霸
    花朵直径可达1米，被誉为“世界花王”。 雌雄异株，其花瓣厚实如腐肉，呈暗红色带白色斑点，散发浓烈尸臭来特异性吸引食腐昆虫来传粉。最奇特的是它无根、茎、叶，一生寄生在热带藤本植物（如崖爬藤）体内，仅开花时露出地面。大王花从宿主汲取营养数年，花苞孕育需9个月，开花仅持续5-7天。花朵凋谢后结出网球大小的果实，内含数千种子，由果蝠或松鼠传播。其种子萌发需精准落入宿主根部裂隙，生存率极低，国际自然保护联盟（IUCN）评估显示，已知的42种大王花中，有25种处于濒危状态。
    大王花现中文名又称大花草，原产于印尼苏门答腊、马来半岛等地的低海拔热带雨林。其学名Rafflesia arnoldi 源自其发现者的名字合称，19世纪英国探险家Stamford Raffles与博物学家Joseph Arnold二人于1818年首次科学记录这一物种，让此雨林奇观走向世界。

[LOTUSSHOWER_GENUS]
莲属
[LOTUSSHOWER_PEDIA]
莲蓬：水泽中的生命摇篮 
    莲蓬是莲（俗称荷花）的花托膨大形成的聚合果。其形似倒置的圆锥，表面密布窝状孔洞，每孔嵌一粒果实，俗称莲子。幼时果皮青绿，成熟黑褐色且变致密坚硬，能够有效隔绝水分、空气和微生物的侵入，极大地减缓了种子内部物质的代谢消耗，使其进入长期休眠状态，是宋代古莲子可休眠千年仍发芽的重要因素。随着莲子的成熟，莲蓬也会逐渐变干枯呈现黑褐色，脱落入水，因其疏松多孔浮力大，如同承载莲子的小船，借水流将其传播出去。
    莲原产亚洲热带至温带水域，中国长江流域、印度恒河平原为原生中心。其幼嫩的莲子可生食或煮食，莲心（胚）可做茶饮。莲蓬因“花开见果”的特性，被赋予“因果同时”“生生不息”的哲学寓意。佛教视其为“莲台”，象征涅槃重生；民间以“莲蓬多子”祈愿子孙绵延。

    植株矮小，叶片呈莲座状排列，肉质肥厚，顶端透明或半透明，形成“窗”，如翡翠上的露珠而得名。而此“窗”不仅可爱，还是其渡过旱期的法宝。当旱季来临，植株大部分会缩回土中来减少水分蒸发，阳光就透过“窗”照射到内部组织来保证其进行光合作用。花序总状，花小（径约5毫米），6瓣，白色或淡粉色；果实椭圆形，内含黑色细小种子。花期3-5月，果期6-8月。
    玉露原产于南非，现作为盆栽多肉植物世界广泛栽培，品种众多。喜凉爽的半阴环境，耐旱怕涝，多通过叶插和分株繁殖。

兜兰属
[PAPHIOPEDILUM_PEDIA]
兜兰——植物界的“拖鞋公主”
    多年生草本植物。株高15-60厘米；叶长圆形排成2列，茎短而包藏于叶基内；多单花顶生，花色丰富；果实为蒴果，种子细小。花期多为春季，果期多为春夏之间。
    兜兰属的植物的统称，因其下部花瓣特化成兜状而得名，又因形似包头拖鞋而名“拖鞋兰”。其可爱的“兜”其实是个巧妙的陷阱。当花盛开时，昆虫受吸引而来，一不小心就会掉入“兜”中，而其内壁光滑，只有一条通往花蕊的路可以攀爬，就这样昆虫在逃生过程中不知不觉地帮助兜兰完成了传粉。
    主要分布在亚洲的热带地区至太平洋岛屿，约110种，多附生于树干或岩石上；我国分布有39个，均为国家重点保护植物。其花秀雅深受人们喜爱，培育的园艺品种已超过2万个。

    辣椒因其茄科植物属性与辛味特征而得名，原产美洲热带地区，最早由南美洲至中美洲一带的古代原住民（约公元前5000年）驯化。16世纪随哥伦布船队传入欧洲，明代中后期（16世纪末）经葡萄牙商船通过海路传入中国，现世界各地广泛种植，在我国众多地区（尤其西南地区）为不可或缺的蔬菜和调味品。辣椒的辛辣感主要来自辣椒素类化合物（辣椒素和二氢辣椒素占90%以上），这些化合物集中在辣椒内部的胎座（白色脉络）和种子周围的腺体中。辣椒素是植物界的“化学武器”：哺乳动物咀嚼果实会因灼痛放弃，而鸟类对辣椒素无感，吞食后完整排出种子，实现高效传播。人类“嗜辣”实属进化意外——痛觉受体TRPV1被激活后释放内啡肽，形成“良性自虐”。农业上，辣椒与玉米、豆类间作可减少虫害，根系分泌物抑制土壤病原菌。

蘑菇——森林隐秘的分解者
    蘑菇是大型真菌的繁殖器官，典型结构（子实体）包括菌盖、菌柄和产孢结构（菌褶/菌管/菌针等）。菌盖形态多样：除伞菌目的典型伞状结构外，还有球状、半球形、漏斗状、蜂窝状等；菌褶或菌管的内侧密布担子/子囊等产孢结构，成熟时单个菌盖每日可释放数亿至万亿孢子。地下菌丝网络（菌丝体）可与一些植物根系形成菌根共生体，通过菌丝桥实现跨物种养分交换与生物电信号传递。其生命周期主要分为营养生长期（菌丝扩展）和生殖生长期（子实体形成）。在温带地区，子实体多在夏秋季节雨后出现；在热带地区，则常见于雨季。从菌丝体分化出原基到子实体成熟，通常仅需3-7天。
    蘑菇全球分布，从极地到雨林均有踪迹。其名可能源于蒙古语“moku”的音译，作为分解者，蘑菇分泌木质素降解酶，将枯木、落叶转化为腐殖质，维系森林物质循环。

棉花——大自然的“白色黄金”
    棉花是锦葵科棉属植物的统称，全球广泛栽培的四种棉，为陆地棉、海岛棉、树棉（俗称“亚洲棉”）和草棉，其中陆地棉种植最广。其植株通常高1-2米；叶片呈掌状分裂，具3-5裂片，表面被柔毛；花朵单生于叶腋，初开乳白色，逐渐转为粉红或紫红色；果实为蒴果（俗称“棉铃”），成熟后裂开，露出露出柔软的白色纤维（俗称“棉絮”），包裹着黑色种子 。花果期为夏秋季。
    因棉花纤维似丝绵但来自植物（“木”）而得“棉”字。我国古代主要栽培纤维粗短的俗称“粗绒棉”的树棉（原产印度，汉代传入）和草棉（原产阿拉伯和小亚细亚，南北朝时期传入）。19世纪末陆地棉（原产美洲墨西哥）通过美国传教士引入我国，新中国成立后，因其高产、纤维长（“细绒棉”）而逐步替代了树棉和草棉，占我国棉花总产量的95%以上，主产区为新疆、黄淮海平原等。而海岛棉原产南美热带和西印度群岛，20世纪50年代从苏联、埃及等国引入新疆试种，因其对热量要求高，仅能在新疆南部小规模种植。其纤维极长（“长绒棉”），品质优异，但产量低，主要用于高端纺织。

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! Where are we? My stomach is growling again!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Welcome to the Steam era! This is the 14th stop of our journey through time and space.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Strange smell! The smoke coming out of these holes doesn't smell like food at all!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows that these holes emit toxic gas that can harm plants.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Ahhhhh! These holes are so deep! I'm getting vertigo just looking down!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE}It is said that the depth of these holes reaches 6666 meters.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} Maybe after a while, something will come out of it.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_8]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}There will certainly be nothing else in the hole! Who'll live in such a deep hole!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE} But our detection instruments don't think so.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE} Using flat-top mushrooms can block the opening of the hole and temporarily prevent poisonous mist and zombies from coming out.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}There's a gentleman like me!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} This is a gentleman zombie in the Steam age.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} hey hey! Feeling the feeling of being able to make friends with him!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Gentleman zombies will cause damage to the rear plants by crossing the carnivorous shield plant.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_3_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses blowing vibranium to blow off the gentleman's zombie umbrella and let it lose its special skills.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} These many guys with parts in their hands! Are they working seriously?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} is certainly not, these should be zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Where is the kitchen here? I want to go and see the food that is not delicious!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} I don't know if there is a kitchen! But you need a power shooter to attack these zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_6_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} lotus root shooter is a powerful long-range output in the Steam Age. It can not only absorb poisonous mist but also cause damage to zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I have an intensive phobia! So many holes!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows that plants or zombies will drill out of the hole.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:crazydave} Is there a spring bed in the hole?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}This is not.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} If you use a hammer to hit zombies, you will get points. If you hit plants, you will deduct points. If you reach a certain score, you can pass the level.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE} consumes gold coins to get a doubling hammer, and hitting zombies can get double points.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_13_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} consumes diamonds to get a no-error double hammer, and you can get double points by hitting zombies and plants.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Is there a guy with a boiler on his back who is losing weight?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's boiler zombies that explode after a while.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Let me ask him if he can carry such a heavy thing without getting tired?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Theoretically he won't feel tired.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_16_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Using ice plants can delay the explosion time of zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} There is a guy coming over pushing a car! Surely there are plenty of good snacks on it!

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that it is a coal miner zombie.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} eh? Do those black ones seem to be inked corn rolls? New variety?

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Those are not ink but coal that bury zombies.

[NARRATIVE_STEAM_21_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} can burn coal using fire plants!

{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! It looks like a place with lots of taco!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is the 13th century, Europe full of literary and artistic atmosphere.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us in the museum.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} See if the collars of those guys look like corn rolls, maybe they also like to eat corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} I don't know if they like corn rolls, but they definitely still like brains the most.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What are those round things? Uh! New taco, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the Vitruvian ring. If you use the ring rationally, it will become a secret weapon against zombies!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} winter melon guards can help us use secret weapons.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_9]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What are those arrows on the ground? As if to say there's a corn roll in front!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_1_INTRO_10]
{SAY:WINNIE}The arrow on the ground determines the rolling direction of the ring.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} ah ah ah ah oh my God! The fog here almost made me unable to open my eyes!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Our detector shows that these fogs are poisonous, be careful!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at that guy holding a bottle in his hand. Could it be a corn roll-flavored drink!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's a perfumer zombie, and the bottle in his hand can create poisonous mist that can cause damage to plants.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! This damn poisonous fog, I'm almost suffocating!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} We need a plant that can purify poisonous mist!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_3_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Aloe vera doctors can purify poisonous mist made by perfumers and increase the attack power of plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I saw a lot of incredible statues, it was so interesting! Lol!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they're definitely because of stealing the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to break them up during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Beware of nightfall.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What's a guy there that looks like he's carving?

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the Sculptor Zombie, which can carve rough stones into zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} looks very interesting, I think I also have the talent to become a sculptor!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that your figure has reduced the success rate by 99.9999.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Destroying the rough stone in advance can prevent sculptor zombies from carving out zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Those guys, the clothes they wear are so strange, they don't walk well! I bet they must be drunk!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} That's the ballet zombies, they always appear in groups of four.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} What a terrible setting, will four people need to share the same corn roll? If so, I would rather appear alone......

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_14_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} uses olives to stop fast-moving ballet zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Take a look at those stone statues!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Those are zombie statues, they will become real zombies at night, we have to use tools to solve them during the day!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} This is really interesting hahaha! I bet they must've eaten the corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_RENAI_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}The number of attention tools is limited.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! Here's what looks like a lot of mustard-flavored corn rolls!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Welcome to join the new time and space journey! It is 10th century, Heian period Japan.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} detector shows us at a shrine near Mount Fuji.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Look at the hairstyles of those guys that look like corn rolls. I'm not sure they really have corn rolls hidden in their hair!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} According to scan analysis, there are no corn rolls hidden in their hair, and they all wear wigs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look! What's that box there? Uh! A lunch box with tornadoes, I guess?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is the money box. Reasonable use of different money boxes will help you deal with zombies better!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_8]
{SAY:WINNIE} Of course, you have to put coins into it first. Oh, I mean your plants food

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_1_INTRO_9]
{SAY:WINNIE} sun Competition Cash Box can return part of the sun planted in nearby plants.
 

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh my God! They have a chimney in their hand, and they're gonna fire!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} warns, that's a fireworks zombie, and the sprayed fireworks will light us up!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Wow! This hot feeling, did they add chili sauce to it?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} The water droplets of ice lotus can extinguish the fireworks flames ejected by the fireworks tube.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_2_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Then what are you waiting for, quick!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Oh! It's an unusual money box for a race, will it have a corn roll in it this time?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Pay attention to the pattern on the money box. This is the energy money box, which allows nearby plants to release their ultimate moves together.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Is there any other case? I wish I had a case that would hold a taco!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dear Dave, forget about the corn rolls for now. This is the plant race cash box,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} can provide you with a high-level plant to help you solve powerful zombies.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Those guys have a lot in their hands! Is this coming to give a gift?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Please be careful, they are ninja kid zombies, holding pufferfish in their hands, alive!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} What do these guys want to do? I bet they must be because I want to steal my tacos!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} The probability of this possibility is 0.01%. At the same time, the information showed that they were experts in the sneak attack.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_5_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} But we have Qianjin Teng, who is an expert in dealing with this kind of ninja.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Uh, again a different box. No taco in it anyway.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Yes, this is a jumping money box that can elevate nearby plants and zombies to the first level, please use it carefully.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! What do you smell? Corn rolls are ten thousand times more fragrant than this thing!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} Dave, I don't have a nose, and secondly it's the sushi chef zombie, who makes quite delicious sushi,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} makes it more difficult for other zombies to eat.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE} However, Pyo Ran is a super chef and is eager to have a gourmet showdown with these sushi chefs.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Maybe it's time for us to give way.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_7_INTRO_6]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} Should I ask him to make me a corn roll?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Wow! What a wind! It feels like it's going to blow my pot helmet off!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} data shows that strong winds often hit this place, and it may be accompanied by terrible cyclones,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} This has a huge impact on us.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} whoa! Can we fight against the power of nature?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE} Please use dendrobium, they can block the whirlwind and prevent the plants from being blown away when planted together

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_11_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE} can also unite to increase strength.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Those guys, the clothes they wear are so weird, they still have fans in their hands!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} I bet they must be hot!

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} That is an Onmyoji zombie, and they have a Tengu fan in their hand. Legend has it that this fan can attract strong winds.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_17_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} aha! That would really make everyone feel cool.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_13_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Look at them, wearing hats and jars, what are you going to do?

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_13_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} has been scanned, it is a raincoat zombie, and the hat can defend against projection attacks,

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_13_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE} fish basket can absorb plants food.

[NARRATIVE_HEIAN_13_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE} aha! Then wouldn't we just attack the front?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Submarine mode activated...100%.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Dave, data shows we're heading to underwater ruins submerged 10,000 years ago.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_1_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Underwater ruins...lost tacos!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}We've been looking for missing stuff, right?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_1_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Scans show underwater zombies are still actively searching for brains.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_1_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE} {PLAYER}, we must prepare!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_1_INTRO_7]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I'll get the dehydrator. Waterlogged tacos taste awful.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_2_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Warning! Multiple intruders detected in this sector!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_2_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}So...does swimming really help lose weight?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Uh, let's not dwell on details...

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_3_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Something's outside the sub!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_3_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Detecting Mollusca, Cephalopoda, Coleoidea, Sepiida, Sepiidae organisms.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_3_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Their ink could be problematic. Exercise caution!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_3_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}!!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_3_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Seafood-flavored tacos this time!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Stars...are we in space?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_4_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Negative. That's not a star but a sea star.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Startled sea stars spin rapidly, accelerating water currents.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_4_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I'm getting seasick already.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_5_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Jellyfish! I know these!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_5_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}We can squeeze jellyfish jam from them!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_5_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Jellyfish are 95-98% water. Jam extraction seems improbable.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_5_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Startled jellyfish may carry away our plants.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_5_INTRO_5]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Jellyfish jam!!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Magic conch shell! Can it answer my questions?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Probability of getting answers: 0%. Probability of hearing your screams: 100%.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_6_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Zombies use hermit crabs as helmets for extra protection!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_6_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}So THAT'S where coneheads came from!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_7_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Alert! Current velocity increasing!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_7_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE} {PLAYER}, we need countermeasures.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_7_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Turn off the sensors!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_8_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Every time I see pufferfish, I wanna poke them.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_8_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}I strongly advise against that, {PLAYER}.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_8_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Deflated balloons fly chaotically. So do pufferfish.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_8_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I love balloons!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_9_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Powerful entities detected.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_9_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I want jellyfish to carry me too!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_9_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Not advisable, {PLAYER}.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_10_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Zombie attacks intensifying.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_10_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}This likely means we're approaching our destination.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_10_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I miss dry land...

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_11_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}What're those pointy-nosed fish?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_11_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Sailfish. Ocean's fastest swimmers.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_11_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Their speed may cause submarine collisions.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_11_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Did we get submarine insurance?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_12_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:zombossicon}{SAY:zombossicon}Can this leaky pickle jar even withstand deep-sea pressure?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_12_INTRO_2]
{SAY:zombossicon}Too bad! I've already completed your foolish expedition!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_12_INTRO_3]
{SAY:zombossicon}My aquatic zombies will shatter your dreams! Your wreckage will become part of the ruins!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_12_INTRO_4]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Living in ruins forever? Needs a sauna though.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_12_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}We'll uncover the truth ourselves, Dave.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_13_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Dave, we've finally reached the underwater ruins.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_13_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Be careful - these accompanying blue whales have enormous appetites now.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_13_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}We dove this deep just to find food?

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_13_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}If only the Puff-Puff vines could control your appetite too.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_14_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows these ruin zombies seem to be holding a trial for outsiders.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_14_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}We break light-speed daily and never get tickets!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_15_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}My analyzer needs more data on these underwater ruin zombies.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_15_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Please complete the virtual experiment per protocol to help my analyzer draw conclusions.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_15_INTRO_3]

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_16_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Mollusks - using shells for protection.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_16_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Just like my cooking pot helmet!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_16_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data shows remarkable shell clamping force.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_17_INTRO_1]

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_17_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Perfect back scrubbers!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_17_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}The plants would disagree, Dave.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_18_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}These zombies seem to want an underwater gladiator battle.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_18_INTRO_2]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Just don't bring a cat!

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_18_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Cats hate water, Dave.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_21_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}The monster battles continue - stranger creatures are coming.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_21_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Data suggests they're from terrifying ocean depths.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_21_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I once stared into the abyss for 15 years without sleep.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_21_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}True story.

[NARRATIVE_ATLANTIS_24_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{SAY:WINNIE}Scanner still needs more data!

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_4_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Penny, what's that thing flying around up there?

{SAY:WINNIE}Beep* Scan complete. That's the Witch. They say she only appears on Halloween.

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_4_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}When she shows up, she charges around on her broomstick, tossing potions down below. Lots of plants have gotten hit on the head.

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_4_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Aha! I've got my super helmet—I'll catch her!

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_4_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}Not the wisest choice—at your height, you'd never catch her.

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_4_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE}Only someone tall enough could stop the witch...

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_1_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Hey! Is that a pumpkin?

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_1_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Negative. Target identified as a magical changing room imbued with mystical power.

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Entities entering it vanish, leaving only their head floating around.

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_1_INTRO_4]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}I bet they must be "body-less" believers!

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_1_INTRO_3]
{SAY:WINNIE}Hitting the pumpkin ghost's head with lobbed projectiles can break the Pumpkin House's. Please switch to lobbed-shot plants!

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_6_INTRO_1]
{NPC_ENTER:CRAZYDAVE}{NPC_ENTER:WINNIE}{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Who's that? The pumpkin knight without his mount!

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_6_INTRO_2]
{SAY:WINNIE}Negative. Scans indicate this unit is a related but distinct individual from the Pumpkin Knight.

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_6_INTRO_3]
{EXCITED:CRAZYDAVE}Just like the relationship between tacos and iron spatulas, right?

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_6_INTRO_4]
{SAY:WINNIE}......

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_6_INTRO_5]
{SAY:WINNIE}This unit has the ability to put plants to sleep.

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_6_INTRO_6]
{SAY:WINNIE}If not awakened in time with Coffee Bean or Plant Food, something terrible might happen!

[NARRATIVE_HALLOWEEN_6_INTRO_7]
{SAY:WINNIE}Proceed with caution!

[GROWTH_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_TITLE]
Growth Pack Description

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY]
Anniversary Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Common zombies appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_DESCRIPTION]
To disguise themselves at the plant's anniversary party, common zombies wear birthday hats. However, because they're made of paper, they lack the defensive capabilities of coneheads.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_FLAG]
Anniversary Flag Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_FLAG_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Marks the arrival of a large wave of anniversary zombies.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_FLAG_DESCRIPTION]
No party is complete without balloons, so the Flag Zombie uses balloons to disguise himself. Later, he spent a long time explaining the difference between this balloon flag and balloon zombies to other zombies, but it's said to have had little effect. So the balloon zombie might also mark the arrival of a large wave of anniversary zombies?

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_GARGANTUAR]
Anniversary Gargantuar Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_GARGANTUAR_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Giant zombies appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_GARGANTUAR_DESCRIPTION]
{KEYWORD}Traits: {STAT} Smashes plants with a power pole.
{KEYWORD} Weakness: {STAT} Drops Imp Zombies when damaged.

{FLAVOR} The giant zombie initially wanted to disguise himself as a gift to sneak into the plant's anniversary party, but later found that gift boxes don't move on their own, so he switched to suspenders.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_PHARAOH]
Anniversary Pharaoh Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_PHARAOH_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Pharaoh zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_PHARAOH_DESCRIPTION]
{KEYWORD} Speed Traits: {STAT} Advances like a hungry tiger.
{KEYWORD} Weakness: {STAT} Nut can block him for a while, but it's safer to use Power Peas to eliminate him.

{FLAVOR}A walking cake? No, that's the Pharaoh zombie. Although cakes are much more fragile than sarcophagi, they still make the Pharaoh zombie stronger. Is it because the Pharaoh gains health by eating cake?

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JUGGLER]
Anniversary Juggler Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JUGGLER_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Juggler zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JUGGLER_DESCRIPTION]
The anniversary juggler zombie can bounce back plant projectiles by spinning rapidly. It is said that he practiced hard for a long time to prevent the cake from flying out during the spin, but wouldn't it be stronger if it did fly out?

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_TROGLOBITE]
Anniversary Troglobite Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_TROGLOBITE_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Troglobite zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_TROGLOBITE_DESCRIPTION]
Compared to the disguise of the anniversary gargantuar zombie, the Troglobite zombie's disguise for common zombies is more thorough, but he forgot to disguise himself.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JETPACK]
Anniversary Jetpack Zombie

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JETPACK_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
Jetpack zombie appearing at the anniversary celebration.

[ZOMBIE_BIRTHDAY_JETPACK_DESCRIPTION]

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE1_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave}wow, it seems like an unbearable zombie has emerged.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE2_1]
Be careful about {NPC_ENTER:winnie} that's not good.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE3_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} let me use my favorite pea shooter to attack

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE4_1]
What happened to {NPC_ENTER:crazydave} totally unmoved, what can we do?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie}beeps.... The test report is out.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_2]
The report says this is Dr. Zombie's latest masterpiece! You need to find a way to beat the toughness value to beat it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_3]
Now zombies are in a high injury free state, only breaking toughness can cause normal damage to zombies.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIE5_4]
{ SAY:winnie } Yellow strips are the toughness value of zombies, do you see the sign next to the toughness value?

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE6_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} I should look at it carefully.

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE7_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Using electric energy attributes to reduce toughness each time, you summoned 5 electric peas to try it!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE8_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} Zombies are in a weak state, and now grab the output! Don't let the zombies come back!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE9_1]
{NPC_ENTER:crazydave} call! It's not easy!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} That's it! Plants using corresponding properties when encountering toughness zombies can break toughness values faster!

[NARRATIVE_RESILIENCE10_2]
{SAY:winnie} According to the reports, there are even higher-level attribute attacks that can inflict more damage on resilience values. I'll leave this exploration to you!

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS1_1]
Be sure Penny looks, how can there be so many magic caps, which one is better for me?

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_1]
{NPC_ENTER:winnie} beeps ... we seem to be at the scene of the event of "Guess Who I am", and each magic cap seems to have something different under it.

[NARRATIVE_COPYCATS2_2]
{SAY:winnie} Oh? I'm a little curious, let me see.

[ADVICE_COPYCATS]
After placing a magic cap, any plants or any zombies may appear, please cultivate carefully! Using Plants to Beat Zombies

Elite Mirror Queen Zombie
[ZOMBIE_PLANTWARS_MIRROR_QUEEN_PHASE3_DESCRIPTION_HEADER]
The Elite Mirror Queen Zombie has a resilience bar mechanism; physical attacks can reduce its resilience (stunning effects can cause high reductions). Emptying the resilience bar puts the zombie into a weakened state, during which the zombie will not act or attack until the resilience bar is fully restored. While the zombie has resilience, it provides damage absorption limits.

[ZOMBIE_PLANTWARS_MIRROR_QUEEN_PHASE3_DESCRIPTION]
The Mirror Queen Zombie spends a lot of time each day indulging in her reflection. She fantasizes that her reflection is stronger and more beautiful than she is now. One day, the mirror finally responded to the queen's wish.
